"The file I</dev/ptmx> is a character file with major number 5 and minor "
"number 2, usually of mode 0666 and owner.group of root.root.  It is used to "
"create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"When a process opens I</dev/ptmx>, it gets a file descriptor for a "
"pseudoterminal master (PTM), and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device is "
"created in the I</dev/pts> directory.  Each file descriptor obtained by "
"opening I</dev/ptmx> is an independent PTM with its own associated PTS, "
"whose path can be found by passing the file descriptor to B<ptsname>(3)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master's file "
"descriptor to B<grantpt>(3)  and B<unlockpt>(3)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave provides "
"processes with an interface that is identical to that of a real terminal."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Data written to the slave is presented on the master file descriptor as "
"input.  Data written to the master is presented to the slave as input."

"In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators "
"such as B<xterm>(1), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is "
"interpreted by the application in the same way a real terminal would "
"interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login programs such as "
"B<sshd>(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across "
"the network to a client program that is connected to a terminal or terminal "
"emulator."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Pseudoterminals can also be used to send input to programs that normally "
"refuse to read input from pipes (such as B<su>(1), and B<passwd>(1))."

"The Linux support for the above (known as UNIX 98 pseudoterminal naming)  is "

"Before this UNIX 98 scheme, master pseudoterminals were called "
"I</dev/ptyp0>, ...  and slave pseudoterminals I</dev/ttyp0>, ...  and one "
