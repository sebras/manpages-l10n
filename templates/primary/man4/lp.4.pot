"B<lp>[0\\(en2] are character devices for the parallel line printers; they "
"have major number 6 and minor number 0\\(en2.  The minor numbers correspond "
"to the printer port base addresses 0x03bc, 0x0378 and 0x0278.  Usually they "
"have mode 220 and are owned by root and group lp.  You can use printer ports "
"either with polling or with interrupts.  Interrupts are recommended when "
"high traffic is expected, for example, for laser printers.  For typical dot "

#.  The printer driver was originally written by Jim Weigand and Linus
#.  Torvalds.
#.  It was further improved by Michael K.\& Johnson.
#.  The interrupt code was written by Nigel Gamble.
#.  Alan Cox modularized it.
#.  LPCAREFUL, LPABORT, LPGETSTATUS were added by Chris Metcalf.
