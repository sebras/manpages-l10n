"The I<gzexe> utility allows you to compress executables in place and have "
"them automatically uncompress and execute when you run them (at a penalty in "
"performance).  For example if you execute ``gzexe /usr/bin/gdb'' it will "
"create the following two files:"

"/usr/bin/gdb~ is the original file and /usr/bin/gdb is the "
