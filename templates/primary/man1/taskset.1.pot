#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<taskset> is used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a running process "
"given its I<pid>, or to launch a new I<command> with a given CPU affinity.  "
"CPU affinity is a scheduler property that \"bonds\" a process to a given set "
"of CPUs on the system.  The Linux scheduler will honor the given CPU "
"affinity and the process will not run on any other CPUs.  Note that the "
"Linux scheduler also supports natural CPU affinity: the scheduler attempts "
"to keep processes on the same CPU as long as practical for performance "
"reasons.  Therefore, forcing a specific CPU affinity is useful only in "
"certain applications."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest order bit "
"corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest order bit "
"corresponding to the last logical CPU.  Not all CPUs may exist on a given "
"system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are present.  A retrieved mask "
"will reflect only the bits that correspond to CPUs physically on the "
"system.  If an invalid mask is given (i.e., one that corresponds to no valid "
"CPUs on the current system) an error is returned.  The masks may be "
"specified in hexadecimal (with or without a leading \"0x\"), or as a CPU "
"list with the B<--cpu-list> option.  For example,"
