#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<ipcrm> removes System V inter-process communication (IPC) objects and "
"associated data structures from the system.  In order to delete such "
"objects, you must be superuser, or the creator or owner of the object."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message queues, and "
"semaphores.  Deletion of a message queue or semaphore object is immediate "
"(regardless of whether any process still holds an IPC identifier for the "
"object).  A shared memory object is only removed after all currently "
"attached processes have detached (B<shmdt>(2))  the object from their "
"virtual address space."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Two syntax styles are supported.  The old Linux historical syntax specifies "
"a three-letter keyword indicating which class of object is to be deleted, "
"followed by one or more IPC identifiers for objects of this type."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The SUS-compliant syntax allows the specification of zero or more objects of "
"all three types in a single command line, with objects specified either by "
"key or by identifier (see below).  Both keys and identifiers may be "
"specified in decimal, hexadecimal (specified with an initial '0x' or '0X'), "
"or octal (specified with an initial '0')."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The details of the removes are described in B<shmctl>(2), B<msgctl>(2), and "
"B<semctl>(2).  The identifiers and keys can be found by using B<ipcs>(1)."

"In its first Linux implementation, B<ipcrm> used the deprecated syntax shown "
"in the second line of the B<SYNOPSIS>.  Functionality present in other *nix "
"implementations of B<ipcrm> has since been added, namely the ability to "
"delete resources by key (not just identifier), and to respect the same "
"command-line syntax.  For backward compatibility the previous syntax is "
"still supported."
