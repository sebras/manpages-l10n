"B<whereis> locates the binary, source and manual files for the specified "
"command names.  The supplied names are first stripped of leading pathname "
"components and any (single) trailing extension of the form B<.>I<ext> (for "
"example: B<.c>)  Prefixes of B<s.> resulting from use of source code control "
"are also dealt with.  B<whereis> then attempts to locate the desired program "
"in the standard Linux places, and in the places specified by B<$PATH> and "
"B<$MANPATH>."
