"B<xzless> is a filter that displays text from compressed files to a "
"terminal.  It works on files compressed with B<xz>(1)  or B<lzma>(1).  If no "
"I<files> are given, B<xzless> reads from standard input."

"B<xzless> uses B<less>(1)  to present its output.  Unlike B<xzmore>, its "
"choice of pager cannot be altered by setting an environment variable.  "
"Commands are based on both B<more>(1)  and B<vi>(1)  and allow back and "
"forth movement and searching.  See the B<less>(1)  manual for more "
"information."
