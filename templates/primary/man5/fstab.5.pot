"The file B<fstab> contains descriptive information about the filesystems the "
"system can mount.  B<fstab> is only read by programs, and not written; it is "
"the duty of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this "
"file.  The order of records in B<fstab> is important because B<fsck>(8), "
"B<mount>(8), and B<umount>(8)  sequentially iterate through B<fstab> doing "
"their thing."

"e.g., `knuth.aeb.nl:/'.  For filesystems with no storage, any string can be "
"used, and will show up in B<df>(1)  output, for example.  Typical usage is "
