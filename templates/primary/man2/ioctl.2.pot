msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The B<ioctl>()  function manipulates the underlying device parameters of "
"special files.  In particular, many operating characteristics of character "
"special files (e.g., terminals) may be controlled with B<ioctl>()  "
"requests.  The argument I<fd> must be an open file descriptor."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The second argument is a device-dependent request code.  The third argument "
"is an untyped pointer to memory.  It's traditionally B<char *>I<argp> (from "
"the days before B<void *> was valid C), and will be so named for this "
"discussion."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"An B<ioctl>()  I<request> has encoded in it whether the argument is an I<in> "
"parameter or I<out> parameter, and the size of the argument I<argp> in "
"bytes.  Macros and defines used in specifying an B<ioctl>()  I<request> are "
"located in the file I<E<lt>sys/ioctl.hE<gt>>."

msgid "RETURN VALUE"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Usually, on success zero is returned.  A few B<ioctl>()  requests use the "
"return value as an output parameter and return a nonnegative value on "
"success.  On error, -1 is returned, and I<errno> is set appropriately."

"No single standard.  Arguments, returns, and semantics of B<ioctl>()  vary "
"according to the device driver in question (the call is used as a catch-all "
"for operations that don't cleanly fit the UNIX stream I/O model).  See "
"B<ioctl_list>(2)  for a list of many of the known B<ioctl>()  calls.  The "
"B<ioctl>()  function call appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX."

"In order to use this call, one needs an open file descriptor.  Often the "
"B<open>(2)  call has unwanted side effects, that can be avoided under Linux "
"by giving it the B<O_NONBLOCK> flag."
