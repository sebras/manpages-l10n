"B<symlink>()  creates a symbolic link named I<linkpath> which contains the "
"string I<target>."

"Symbolic links are interpreted at run time as if the contents of the link "
"had been substituted into the path being followed to find a file or "
"directory."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Symbolic links may contain I<..> path components, which (if used at the "
"start of the link) refer to the parent directories of that in which the link "
"resides."

"to a nonexistent one; the latter case is known as a dangling link."

"when following the link, but is checked when removal or renaming of the link "
"is requested and the link is in a directory with the sticky bit (B<S_ISVTX>)  "
