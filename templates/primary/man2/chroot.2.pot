"B<chroot>()  changes the root directory of the calling process to that "
"specified in I<path>.  This directory will be used for pathnames beginning "
"with I</>.  The root directory is inherited by all children of the calling "
"process."

"This call changes an ingredient in the pathname resolution process and does "
"nothing else.  In particular, it is not intended to be used for any kind of "
"security purpose, neither to fully sandbox a process nor to restrict "
"filesystem system calls.  In the past, B<chroot>()  has been used by daemons "
"to restrict themselves prior to passing paths supplied by untrusted users to "
"system calls such as B<open>(2).  However, if a folder is moved out of the "
"chroot directory, an attacker can exploit that to get out of the chroot "
"directory as well.  The easiest way to do that is to B<chdir>(2)  to the "
"to-be-moved directory, wait for it to be moved out, then open a path like "
"../../../etc/passwd."

"A slightly trickier variation also works under some circumstances if "
"B<chdir>(2)  is not permitted.  If a daemon allows a \"chroot directory\" to "
"be specified, that usually means that if you want to prevent remote users "
"from accessing files outside the chroot directory, you must ensure that "
"folders are never moved out of it."
