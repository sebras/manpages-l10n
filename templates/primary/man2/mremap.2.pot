msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<mremap>()  expands (or shrinks) an existing memory mapping, potentially "
"moving it at the same time (controlled by the I<flags> argument and the "
"available virtual address space)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"I<old_address> is the old address of the virtual memory block that you want "
"to expand (or shrink).  Note that I<old_address> has to be page aligned.  "
"I<old_size> is the old size of the virtual memory block.  I<new_size> is the "
"requested size of the virtual memory block after the resize.  An optional "
"fifth argument, I<new_address>, may be provided; see the description of "
"B<MREMAP_FIXED> below."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"In Linux the memory is divided into pages.  A user process has (one or)  "
"several linear virtual memory segments.  Each virtual memory segment has one "
"or more mappings to real memory pages (in the page table).  Each virtual "
"memory segment has its own protection (access rights), which may cause a "
"segmentation violation if the memory is accessed incorrectly (e.g., writing "
"to a read-only segment).  Accessing virtual memory outside of the segments "
"will also cause a segmentation violation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<mremap>()  uses the Linux page table scheme.  B<mremap>()  changes the "
"mapping between virtual addresses and memory pages.  This can be used to "
"implement a very efficient B<realloc>(3)."

"By default, if there is not sufficient space to expand a mapping at its "
"current location, then B<mremap>()  fails.  If this flag is specified, then "
"the kernel is permitted to relocate the mapping to a new virtual address, if "
"necessary.  If the mapping is relocated, then absolute pointers into the old "
"mapping location become invalid (offsets relative to the starting address of "
"the mapping should be employed)."

"This flag serves a similar purpose to the B<MAP_FIXED> flag of B<mmap>(2).  "
"If this flag is specified, then B<mremap>()  accepts a fifth argument, "
"I<void\\ *new_address>, which specifies a page-aligned address to which the "
"mapping must be moved.  Any previous mapping at the address range specified "
"by I<new_address> and I<new_size> is unmapped.  If B<MREMAP_FIXED> is "
"specified, then B<MREMAP_MAYMOVE> must also be specified."

"locked by the process may change."
