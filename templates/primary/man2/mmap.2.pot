"B<mmap>()  creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling "

"POSIX specifies that the system shall always zero fill any partial page at "

"the object beyond its end.  On Linux, when you write data to such partial "
"page after the end of the object, the data stays in the page cache even "
"after the file is closed and unmapped and even though the data is never "
"written to the file itself, subsequent mappings may see the modified "
"content.  In some cases, this could be fixed by calling B<msync>(2)  before "
"the unmap takes place; however, this doesn't work on B<tmpfs>(5)  (for "
"example, when using the POSIX shared memory interface documented in "
