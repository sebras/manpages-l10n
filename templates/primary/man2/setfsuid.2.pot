msgid ""
"The system call B<setfsuid>()  changes the value of the caller's filesystem "
"user ID\\(emthe user ID that the Linux kernel uses to check for all accesses "
"to the filesystem.  Normally, the value of the filesystem user ID will "
"shadow the value of the effective user ID.  In fact, whenever the effective "
"user ID is changed, the filesystem user ID will also be changed to the new "
"value of the effective user ID."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Explicit calls to B<setfsuid>()  and B<setfsgid>(2)  are usually used only "
"by programs such as the Linux NFS server that need to change what user and "
"group ID is used for file access without a corresponding change in the real "
"and effective user and group IDs.  A change in the normal user IDs for a "
"program such as the NFS server is a security hole that can expose it to "
"unwanted signals.  (But see below.)"

"B<setfsuid>()  will succeed only if the caller is the superuser or if "

msgid ""
"At the time when this system call was introduced, one process could send a "
"signal to another process with the same effective user ID.  This meant that "
"if a privileged process changed its effective user ID for the purpose of "
"file permission checking, then it could become vulnerable to receiving "
"signals sent by another (unprivileged) process with the same user ID.  The "
"filesystem user ID attribute was thus added to allow a process to change its "
"user ID for the purposes of file permission checking without at the same "
"time becoming vulnerable to receiving unwanted signals.  Since Linux 2.0, "
"signal permission handling is different (see B<kill>(2)), with the result "
"that a process change can change its effective user ID without being "
"vulnerable to receiving signals from unwanted processes.  Thus, "
"B<setfsuid>()  is nowadays unneeded and should be avoided in new "
"applications (likewise for B<setfsgid>(2))."

"The original Linux B<setfsuid>()  system call supported only 16-bit user "
"IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added B<setfsuid32>()  supporting 32-bit IDs.  "
"The glibc B<setfsuid>()  wrapper function transparently deals with the "
"variation across kernel versions."

"In glibc 2.15 and earlier, when the wrapper for this system call determines "
"that the argument can't be passed to the kernel without integer truncation "
"(because the kernel is old and does not support 32-bit user IDs), they will "
"return -1 and set I<errno> to B<EINVAL> without attempting the system call."

msgid ""
"No error indications of any kind are returned to the caller, and the fact "
"that both successful and unsuccessful calls return the same value makes it "
"impossible to directly determine whether the call succeeded or failed.  "
"Instead, the caller must resort to looking at the return value from a "
"further call such as I<setfsuid(-1)> (which will always fail), in order to "
"determine if a preceding call to B<setfsuid>()  changed the filesystem user "
"ID.  At the very least, B<EPERM> should be returned when the call fails "
"(because the caller lacks the B<CAP_SETUID> capability)."
