msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fsync>()  transfers (\"flushes\") all modified in-core data of (i.e., "
"modified buffer cache pages for) the file referred to by the file descriptor "
"I<fd> to the disk device (or other permanent storage device) so that all "
"changed information can be retrieved even after the system crashed or was "
"rebooted.  This includes writing through or flushing a disk cache if "
"present.  The call blocks until the device reports that the transfer has "
"completed.  It also flushes metadata information associated with the file "
"(see B<inode>(7))."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Calling B<fsync>()  does not necessarily ensure that the entry in the "
"directory containing the file has also reached disk.  For that an explicit "
"B<fsync>()  on a file descriptor for the directory is also needed."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<fdatasync>()  is similar to B<fsync>(), but does not flush modified "
"metadata unless that metadata is needed in order to allow a subsequent data "
"retrieval to be correctly handled.  For example, changes to I<st_atime> or "
"I<st_mtime> (respectively, time of last access and time of last "
"modification; see B<inode>(7))  do not require flushing because they are not "
"necessary for a subsequent data read to be handled correctly.  On the other "
"hand, a change to the file size (I<st_size>, as made by say "
"B<ftruncate>(2)), would require a metadata flush."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The aim of B<fdatasync>()  is to reduce disk activity for applications that "
"do not require all metadata to be synchronized with the disk."
