"whether unprivileged processes may set the real user ID to the real user ID, "

"At the kernel level, user IDs and group IDs are a per-thread attribute.  "
"However, POSIX requires that all threads in a process share the same "
"credentials.  The NPTL threading implementation handles the POSIX "
"requirements by providing wrapper functions for the various system calls "
"that change process UIDs and GIDs.  These wrapper functions (including those "
"for B<setreuid>()  and B<setregid>())  employ a signal-based technique to "
"ensure that when one thread changes credentials, all of the other threads in "
"the process also change their credentials.  For details, see B<nptl>(7)."
