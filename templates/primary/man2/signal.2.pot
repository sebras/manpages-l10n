"The only portable use of B<signal>()  is to set a signal's disposition to "
"B<SIG_DFL> or B<SIG_IGN>.  The semantics when using B<signal>()  to "

"POSIX.1 solved the portability mess by specifying B<sigaction>(2), which "

"In the original UNIX systems, when a handler that was established using "
"B<signal>()  was invoked by the delivery of a signal, the disposition of the "
"signal would be reset to B<SIG_DFL>, and the system did not block delivery "
"of further instances of the signal.  This is equivalent to calling "

"System\\ V also provides these semantics for B<signal>().  This was bad "
"because the signal might be delivered again before the handler had a chance "

"could result in recursive invocations of the handler."

"BSD improved on this situation, but unfortunately also changed the semantics "
"of the existing B<signal>()  interface while doing so.  On BSD, when a "
"signal handler is invoked, the signal disposition is not reset, and further "
"instances of the signal are blocked from being delivered while the handler "
"is executing.  Furthermore, certain blocking system calls are automatically "
"restarted if interrupted by a signal handler (see B<signal>(7)).  The BSD "
"semantics are equivalent to calling B<sigaction>(2)  with the following "
