"B<umask>()  sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to "
"I<mask> & 0777 (i.e., only the file permission bits of I<mask> are used), "
"and returns the previous value of the mask."

"The umask is used by B<open>(2), B<mkdir>(2), and other system calls that "
"create files to modify the permissions placed on newly created files or "
"directories.  Specifically, permissions in the umask are turned off from the "
"I<mode> argument to B<open>(2)  and B<mkdir>(2)."

#. type: Plain text

"Alternatively, if the parent directory has a default ACL (see B<acl>(5)), "
"the umask is ignored, the default ACL is inherited, the permission bits are "
"set based on the inherited ACL, and permission bits absent in the I<mode> "
"argument are turned off.  For example, the following default ACL is "
"equivalent to a umask of 022:"
