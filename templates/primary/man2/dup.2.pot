#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The B<dup>()  system call creates a copy of the file descriptor I<oldfd>, "
"using the lowest-numbered unused file descriptor for the new descriptor."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"After a successful return, the old and new file descriptors may be used "
"interchangeably.  They refer to the same open file description (see "
"B<open>(2))  and thus share file offset and file status flags; for example, "
"if the file offset is modified by using B<lseek>(2)  on one of the file "
"descriptors, the offset is also changed for the other."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The two file descriptors do not share file descriptor flags (the "
"close-on-exec flag).  The close-on-exec flag (B<FD_CLOEXEC>; see "
"B<fcntl>(2))  for the duplicate descriptor is off."

#. type: SS

msgid "dup2()"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The B<dup2>()  system call performs the same task as B<dup>(), but instead "
"of using the lowest-numbered unused file descriptor, it uses the file "
"descriptor number specified in I<newfd>.  If the file descriptor I<newfd> "
"was previously open, it is silently closed before being reused."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The steps of closing and reusing the file descriptor I<newfd> are performed "
"I<atomically>.  This is important, because trying to implement equivalent "
"functionality using B<close>(2)  and B<dup>()  would be subject to race "
"conditions, whereby I<newfd> might be reused between the two steps.  Such "
"reuse could happen because the main program is interrupted by a signal "
"handler that allocates a file descriptor, or because a parallel thread "
"allocates a file descriptor."
