"Since kernel 2.0, B<flock>()  is implemented as a system call in its own "
"right rather than being emulated in the GNU C library as a call to "
"B<fcntl>(2).  With this implementation, there is no interaction between the "
"types of lock placed by B<flock>()  and B<fcntl>(2), and B<flock>()  does "
"not detect deadlock.  (Note, however, that on some systems, such as the "
"modern BSDs, B<flock>()  and B<fcntl>(2)  locks I<do> interact with one "
"another.)"

msgid ""
"In Linux kernels up to 2.6.11, B<flock>()  does not lock files over NFS "
"(i.e., the scope of locks was limited to the local system).  Instead, one "
"could use B<fcntl>(2)  byte-range locking, which does work over NFS, given a "
"sufficiently recent version of Linux and a server which supports locking.  "
"Since Linux 2.6.12, NFS clients support B<flock>()  locks by emulating them "
"as byte-range locks on the entire file.  This means that B<fcntl>(2)  and "
"B<flock>()  locks I<do> interact with one another over NFS.  Since Linux "
"2.6.37, the kernel supports a compatibility mode that allows B<flock>()  "
"locks (and also B<fcntl>(2)  byte region locks) to be treated as local; see "
"the discussion of the I<local_lock> option in B<nfs>(5)."

"Converting a lock (shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not guaranteed to "
"be atomic: the existing lock is first removed, and then a new lock is "
"established.  Between these two steps, a pending lock request by another "

"or fails if B<LOCK_NB> was specified.  (This is the original BSD behavior, "
