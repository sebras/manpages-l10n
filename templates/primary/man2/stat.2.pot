#.  A note from Andries Brouwer, July 2007
#
#.  > Is the story not rather more complicated for some calls like
#.  > stat(2)?
#
#.  Yes and no, mostly no. See /usr/include/sys/stat.h .
#
#.  The idea is here not so much that syscalls change, but that
#.  the definitions of struct stat and of the types dev_t and mode_t change.
#.  This means that libc (even if it does not call the kernel
#.  but only calls some internal function) must know what the
#.  format of dev_t or of struct stat is.
#.  The communication between the application and libc goes via
#.  the include file <sys/stat.h> that defines a _STAT_VER and
#.  _MKNOD_VER describing the layout of the data that user space
#.  uses. Each (almost each) occurrence of stat() is replaced by
#.  an occurrence of xstat() where the first parameter of xstat()
#.  is this version number _STAT_VER.
#
#.  Now, also the definitions used by the kernel change.
#.  But glibc copes with this in the standard way, and the
#.  struct stat as returned by the kernel is repacked into
#.  the struct stat as expected by the application.
#.  Thus, _STAT_VER and this setup cater for the application-libc
#.  interface, rather than the libc-kernel interface.
#
#.  (Note that the details depend on gcc being used as c compiler.)
