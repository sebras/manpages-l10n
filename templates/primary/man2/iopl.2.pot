#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<iopl>()  changes the I/O privilege level of the calling process, as "
"specified by the two least significant bits in I<level>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This call is necessary to allow 8514-compatible X servers to run under "
"Linux.  Since these X servers require access to all 65536 I/O ports, the "
"B<ioperm>(2)  call is not sufficient."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"In addition to granting unrestricted I/O port access, running at a higher "
"I/O privilege level also allows the process to disable interrupts.  This "
"will probably crash the system, and is not recommended."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Permissions are not inherited by the child process created by B<fork>(2)  "
"and are not preserved across B<execve>(2)  (but see NOTES)."
