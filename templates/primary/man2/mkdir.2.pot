"The argument I<mode> specifies the mode for the new directory (see "
"B<inode>(7)).  It is modified by the process's I<umask> in the usual way: in "
"the absence of a default ACL, the mode of the created directory is (I<mode> "
"& ~I<umask> & 0777).  Whether other I<mode> bits are honored for the created "
"directory depends on the operating system.  For Linux, see NOTES below."

"The newly created directory will be owned by the effective user ID of the "
"process.  If the directory containing the file has the set-group-ID bit set, "
"or if the filesystem is mounted with BSD group semantics (I<mount -o "
