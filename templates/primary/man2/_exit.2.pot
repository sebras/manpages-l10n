"The function B<_exit>()  terminates the calling process \"immediately\".  "
"Any open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed.  Any children "
"of the process are inherited by B<init>(1)  (or by the nearest \"subreaper\" "
"process as defined through the use of the B<prctl>(2)  "
"B<PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER> operation).  The process's parent is sent a "
"B<SIGCHLD> signal."

#. type: Plain text

"The value I<status & 0377> is returned to the parent process as the "
"process's exit status, and can be collected using one of the B<wait>(2)  "
"family of calls."

"The function B<_exit>()  is like B<exit>(3), but does not call any functions "
"registered with B<atexit>(3)  or B<on_exit>(3).  Open B<stdio>(3)  streams "
"are not flushed.  On the other hand, B<_exit>()  does close open file "
"descriptors, and this may cause an unknown delay, waiting for pending output "
"to finish.  If the delay is undesired, it may be useful to call functions "
"like B<tcflush>(3)  before calling B<_exit>().  Whether any pending I/O is "
"canceled, and which pending I/O may be canceled upon B<_exit>(), is "
"implementation-dependent."
