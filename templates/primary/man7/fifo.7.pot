#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A FIFO special file (a named pipe) is similar to a pipe, except that it is "
"accessed as part of the filesystem.  It can be opened by multiple processes "
"for reading or writing.  When processes are exchanging data via the FIFO, "
"the kernel passes all data internally without writing it to the filesystem.  "
"Thus, the FIFO special file has no contents on the filesystem; the "
"filesystem entry merely serves as a reference point so that processes can "
"access the pipe using a name in the filesystem."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The kernel maintains exactly one pipe object for each FIFO special file that "
"is opened by at least one process.  The FIFO must be opened on both ends "
"(reading and writing)  before data can be passed.  Normally, opening the "
"FIFO blocks until the other end is opened also."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A process can open a FIFO in nonblocking mode.  In this case, opening for "
"read-only will succeed even if no-one has opened on the write side yet and "
"opening for write-only will fail with B<ENXIO> (no such device or address) "
"unless the other end has already been opened."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Under Linux, opening a FIFO for read and write will succeed both in blocking "
"and nonblocking mode.  POSIX leaves this behavior undefined.  This can be "
"used to open a FIFO for writing while there are no readers available.  A "
"process that uses both ends of the connection in order to communicate with "
"itself should be very careful to avoid deadlocks."
