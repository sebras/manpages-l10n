"There are other ways to represent that number.  The pair (a,b) of real "
"numbers may be viewed as a point in the plane, given by X- and "
"Y-coordinates.  This same point may also be described by giving the pair of "
"real numbers (r,phi), where r is the distance to the origin O, and phi the "
"angle between the X-axis and the line Oz.  Now z = r*exp(i*phi) = "
