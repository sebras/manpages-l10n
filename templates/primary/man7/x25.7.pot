"X25 sockets provide an interface to the X.25 packet layer protocol.  This "
"allows applications to communicate over a public X.25 data network as "
"standardized by International Telecommunication Union's recommendation X.25 "
"(X.25 DTE-DCE mode).  X25 sockets can also be used for communication without "
"an intermediate X.25 network (X.25 DTE-DTE mode) as described in ISO-8208."

"Message boundaries are preserved \\(em a B<read>(2)  from a socket will "
"retrieve the same chunk of data as output with the corresponding B<write>(2)  "
"to the peer socket.  When necessary, the kernel takes care of segmenting and "
"reassembling long messages by means of the X.25 M-bit.  There is no "
"hard-coded upper limit for the message size.  However, reassembling of a "
"long message might fail if there is a temporary lack of system resources or "
"when other constraints (such as socket memory or buffer size limits) become "
"effective.  If that occurs, the X.25 connection will be reset."

"read from or written to the socket.  For data read from the socket, a 0 "
"first byte indicates that the Q-bits of the corresponding incoming data "
