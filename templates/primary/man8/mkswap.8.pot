"The I<device> argument will usually be a disk partition (something like "
"I</dev/sdb7>)  but can also be a file.  The Linux kernel does not look at "
"partition IDs, but many installation scripts will assume that partitions of "
"hex type 82 (LINUX_SWAP) are meant to be swap partitions.  (B<Warning: "
"Solaris also uses this type.  Be careful not to kill your Solaris "
"partitions.>)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The I<size> parameter is superfluous but retained for backwards "
"compatibility.  (It specifies the desired size of the swap area in 1024-byte "
"blocks.  B<mkswap> will use the entire partition or file if it is omitted.  "
"Specifying it is unwise \\(en a typo may destroy your disk.)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"After creating the swap area, you need the B<swapon> command to start using "
"it.  Usually swap areas are listed in I</etc/fstab> so that they can be "
"taken into use at boot time by a B<swapon -a> command in some boot script."
