"systemd-fstab-generator is a generator that translates /etc/fstab (see "
"B<fstab>(5)  for details) into native systemd units early at boot and when "
"configuration of the system manager is reloaded\\&. This will instantiate "
"mount and swap units as necessary\\&."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"The I<passno> field is treated like a simple boolean, and the ordering "
"information is discarded\\&. However, if the root file system is checked, it "

"One special topic is handling of symbolic links\\&. Historical init "
"implementations supported symlinks in /etc/fstab\\&. Because mount units "
"will refuse mounts where the target is a symbolic link, this generator will "
"resolve any symlinks as far as possible when processing /etc/fstab in order "
"to enhance backwards compatibility\\&. If a symlink target does not exist at "
"the time that this generator runs, it is assumed that the symlink target is "
"the final target of the mount\\&."
