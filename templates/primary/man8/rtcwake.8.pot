msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This program is used to enter a system sleep state and to automatically wake "
"from it at a specified time."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This uses cross-platform Linux interfaces to enter a system sleep state, and "
"leave it no later than a specified time.  It uses any RTC framework driver "
"that supports standard driver model wakeup flags."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This is normally used like the old B<apmsleep> utility, to wake from a "
"suspend state like ACPI S1 (standby) or S3 (suspend-to-RAM).  Most platforms "
"can implement those without analogues of BIOS, APM, or ACPI."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"On some systems, this can also be used like B<nvram-wakeup>, waking from "
"states like ACPI S4 (suspend to disk).  Not all systems have persistent "
"media that are appropriate for such suspend modes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Note that alarm functionality depends on hardware; not every RTC is able to "
"setup an alarm up to 24 hours in the future."
