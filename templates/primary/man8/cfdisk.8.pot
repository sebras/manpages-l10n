"B<cfdisk> is a curses-based program for partitioning any block device.  The "
"default device is I</dev/sda>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Note that B<cfdisk> provides basic partitioning functionality with a "
"user-friendly interface.  If you need advanced features, use B<fdisk>(8)  "
"instead."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Since version 2.25 B<cfdisk> supports MBR (DOS), GPT, SUN and SGI disk "
"labels, but no longer provides any functionality for CHS "
"(Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing.  CHS has never been important for Linux, "
"and this addressing concept does not make any sense for new devices."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Since version 2.25 B<cfdisk> also does not provide a 'print' command any "
"more.  This functionality is provided by the utilities B<partx>(8)  and "
"B<lsblk>(8)  in a very comfortable and rich way."
