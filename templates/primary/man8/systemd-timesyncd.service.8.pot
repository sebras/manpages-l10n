"systemd-timesyncd is a system service that may be used to synchronize the "
"local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol server\\&. It also "
"saves the local time to disk every time the clock has been synchronized and "
"uses this to possibly advance the system realtime clock on subsequent "
"reboots to ensure it monotonically advances even if the system lacks a "
"battery-buffered RTC chip\\&."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP\\&. This "
"minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly "
"adjust it for smaller deltas\\&. More complex use cases are not covered by "
"systemd-timesyncd\\&."

"The NTP servers contacted are determined from the global settings in "
"B<timesyncd.conf>(5), the per-link static settings in \\&.network files, and "
"the per-link dynamic settings received over DHCP\\&. See "
