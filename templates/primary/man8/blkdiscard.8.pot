#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"B<blkdiscard> is used to discard device sectors.  This is useful for "
"solid-state drivers (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.  Unlike "
"B<fstrim>(8), this command is used directly on the block device."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"By default, B<blkdiscard> will discard all blocks on the device.  Options "
"may be used to modify this behavior based on range or size, as explained "
"below."

msgid "The I<device> argument is the pathname of the block device."

"The I<offset> and I<length> arguments may be followed by the multiplicative "

"ZiB and YiB (the \"iB\" is optional, e.g., \"K\" has the same meaning as "
"\"KiB\") or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, "
