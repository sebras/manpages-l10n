"If I<expression> is false (i.e., compares equal to zero), B<assert>()  "
"prints an error message to standard error and terminates the program by "
"calling B<abort>(3).  The error message includes the name of the file and "
"function containing the B<assert>()  call, the source code line number of "
"the call, and the text of the argument; something like:"

"If the macro B<NDEBUG> is defined at the moment I<E<lt>assert.hE<gt>> was "
"last included, the macro B<assert>()  generates no code, and hence does "
"nothing at all.  It is not recommended to define B<NDEBUG> if using "
"B<assert>()  to detect error conditions since the software may behave "
"non-deterministically."
