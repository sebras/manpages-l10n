"The three types of buffering available are unbuffered, block buffered, and "
"line buffered.  When an output stream is unbuffered, information appears on "
"the destination file or terminal as soon as written; when it is block "
"buffered many characters are saved up and written as a block; when it is "
"line buffered characters are saved up until a newline is output or input is "
"read from any stream attached to a terminal device (typically I<stdin>).  "
"The function B<fflush>(3)  may be used to force the block out early.  (See "
"B<fclose>(3).)"

#. type: Plain text

"Normally all files are block buffered.  If a stream refers to a terminal (as "
"I<stdout> normally does), it is line buffered.  The standard error stream "
"I<stderr> is always unbuffered by default."

"The B<setvbuf>()  function may be used on any open stream to change its "
"buffer.  The I<mode> argument must be one of the following three macros:"

"Except for unbuffered files, the I<buf> argument should point to a buffer at "
"least I<size> bytes long; this buffer will be used instead of the current "
"buffer.  If the argument I<buf> is NULL, only the mode is affected; a new "
"buffer will be allocated on the next read or write operation.  The "
"B<setvbuf>()  function may be used only after opening a stream and before "
"any other operations have been performed on it."
