"All functions registered with B<atexit>(3)  and B<on_exit>(3)  are called, "
"in the reverse order of their registration.  (It is possible for one of "
"these functions to use B<atexit>(3)  or B<on_exit>(3)  to register an "
"additional function to be executed during exit processing; the new "
"registration is added to the front of the list of functions that remain to "
"be called.)  If one of these functions does not return (e.g., it calls "
"B<_exit>(2), or kills itself with a signal), then none of the remaining "
"functions is called, and further exit processing (in particular, flushing of "
"B<stdio>(3)  streams) is abandoned.  If a function has been registered "
"multiple times using B<atexit>(3)  or B<on_exit>(3), then it is called as "
"many times as it was registered."

"The use of B<EXIT_SUCCESS> and B<EXIT_FAILURE> is slightly more portable (to "
