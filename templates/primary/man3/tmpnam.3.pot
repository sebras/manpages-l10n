"The B<tmpnam>()  function returns a pointer to a string that is a valid "
"filename, and such that a file with this name did not exist at some point in "
"time, so that naive programmers may think it a suitable name for a temporary "
"file.  If the argument I<s> is NULL, this name is generated in an internal "
"static buffer and may be overwritten by the next call to B<tmpnam>().  If "
"I<s> is not NULL, the name is copied to the character array (of length at "
"least I<L_tmpnam>)  pointed to by I<s> and the value I<s> is returned in "
"case of success."
