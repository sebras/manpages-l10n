"Some programmers consider B<strncpy>()  to be inefficient and error prone.  "
"If the programmer knows (i.e., includes code to test!)  that the size of "
"I<dest> is greater than the length of I<src>, then B<strcpy>()  can be used."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"One valid (and intended) use of B<strncpy>()  is to copy a C string to a "
"fixed-length buffer while ensuring both that the buffer is not overflowed "
"and that unused bytes in the target buffer are zeroed out (perhaps to "
"prevent information leaks if the buffer is to be written to media or "
"transmitted to another process via an interprocess communication technique)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"If there is no terminating null byte in the first I<n> bytes of I<src>, "
"B<strncpy>()  produces an unterminated string in I<dest>.  If I<buf> has "
"length I<buflen>, you can force termination using something like the "
"following:"

"This function is similar to B<strncpy>(), but it copies at most I<size-1> "
"bytes to I<dest>, always adds a terminating null byte, and does not pad the "
"target with (further) null bytes.  This function fixes some of the problems "
"of B<strcpy>()  and B<strncpy>(), but the caller must still handle the "
"possibility of data loss if I<size> is too small.  The return value of the "
"function is the length of I<src>, which allows truncation to be easily "
"detected: if the return value is greater than or equal to I<size>, "
"truncation occurred.  If loss of data matters, the caller I<must> either "
"check the arguments before the call, or test the function return value.  "
"B<strlcpy>()  is not present in glibc and is not standardized by POSIX, but "
"is available on Linux via the I<libbsd> library."

msgid ""
"If the destination string of a B<strcpy>()  is not large enough, then "
"anything might happen.  Overflowing fixed-length string buffers is a "
"favorite cracker technique for taking complete control of the machine.  Any "
"time a program reads or copies data into a buffer, the program first needs "
"to check that there's enough space.  This may be unnecessary if you can show "
"that overflow is impossible, but be careful: programs can get changed over "
"time, in ways that may make the impossible possible."
