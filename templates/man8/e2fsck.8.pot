"B<e2fsck> is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file systems.  For "
"ext3 and ext4 file systems that use a journal, if the system has been shut "
"down uncleanly without any errors, normally, after replaying the committed "
"transactions in the journal, the file system should be marked as clean.  "
"Hence, for file systems that use journaling, B<e2fsck> will normally replay "
"the journal and exit, unless its superblock indicates that further checking "
"is required."
