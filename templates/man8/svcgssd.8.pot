"The rpcsec_gss protocol gives a means of using the gss-api generic security "
"api to provide security for protocols using rpc (in particular, nfs).  "
"Before exchanging any rpc requests using rpcsec_gss, the rpc client must "
"first establish a security context with the rpc server.  The linux kernel's "
"implementation of rpcsec_gss depends on the userspace daemon B<rpc.svcgssd> "
"to handle context establishment on the rpc server.  The daemon uses files in "
"the proc filesystem to communicate with the kernel."
