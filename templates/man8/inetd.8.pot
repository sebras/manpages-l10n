"E<.Nm inetd> listens for connections on certain internet sockets.  When a "
"connection is found on one of its sockets, it decides what service the "
"socket corresponds to, and invokes a program to service the request.  After "
"the program is finished, it continues to listen on the socket (except in "
"some cases which will be described below).  Essentially, E<.Nm inetd> allows "
"running one daemon to invoke several others, reducing load on the system."
