"B<rpmgraph> uses I<PACKAGE_FILE> arguments to generate a package dependency "
"graph. Each I<PACKAGE_FILE> argument is read and added to an rpm transaction "
"set. The elements of the transaction set are partially ordered using a "
"topological sort. The partially ordered elements are then printed to "
"standard output."

"Nodes in the dependency graph are package names, and edges in the directed "
"graph point to the parent of each node. The parent node is defined as the "
"last predecessor of a package when partially ordered using the package "
"dependencies as a relation. That means that the parent of a given package is "
"the package's last prerequisite."

"The output is in B<dot>(1) directed graph format, and can be displayed or "
"printed using the B<dotty> graph editor from the B<graphviz> package.  There "
"are no B<rpmgraph> specific options, only common B<rpm> options.  See the "
"B<rpmgraph> usage message for what is currently implemented."
