"B<nss-resolve> is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) "
"functionality of the GNU C Library (B<glibc>) enabling it to resolve "
"hostnames via the B<systemd-resolved>(8)  local network name resolution "
"service\\&. It replaces the B<nss-dns> plug-in module that traditionally "
"resolves hostnames via DNS\\&."

"To activate the NSS module, add \"resolve\\ \\&[!UNAVAIL=return]\" to the "
"line starting with \"hosts:\" in /etc/nsswitch\\&.conf\\&. Specifically, it "
"is recommended to place \"resolve\" early in /etc/nsswitch\\&.conf\\*(Aqs "
"\"hosts:\" line\\&. It should be before the \"files\" entry, since systemd-"
"resolved supports /etc/hosts internally, but with caching\\&. To the "
"contrary, it should be after \"mymachines\", to give hostnames given to "
"local VMs and containers precedence over names received over DNS\\&. "
"Finally, we recommend placing \"dns\" somewhere after \"resolve\", to fall "
