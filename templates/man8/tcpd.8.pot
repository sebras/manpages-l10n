"The I<tcpd> program can be set up to monitor incoming requests for "
"I<telnet>, I<finger>, I<ftp>, I<exec>, I<rsh>, I<rlogin>, I<tftp>, I<talk>, "
"I<comsat> and other services that have a one-to-one mapping onto executable "
"files."

"The program supports both 4.3BSD-style sockets and System V.4-style TLI.  "
"Functionality may be limited when the protocol underneath TLI is not an "
"internet protocol."

"There are two possible modes of operation: execution of I<tcpd> before a "
"service started by I<inetd>, or linking a daemon with the I<libwrap> shared "
"library as documented in the I<hosts_access>(3)  manual page. Operation when "
"started by I<inetd> is as follows: whenever a request for service arrives, "
"the I<inetd> daemon is tricked into running the I<tcpd> program instead of "
"the desired server. I<tcpd> logs the request and does some additional "
"checks. When all is well, I<tcpd> runs the appropriate server program and "
"goes away."

"Optional features are: pattern-based access control, client username lookups "

"have someone elses host name, and protection against hosts that pretend to "

"Connections that are monitored by I<tcpd> are reported through the "
