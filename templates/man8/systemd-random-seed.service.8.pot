"systemd-random-seed\\&.service is a service that loads an on-disk random "
"seed into the kernel entropy pool during boot and saves it at shutdown\\&. "
"See B<random>(4)  for details\\&. By default, no entropy is credited when "
"the random seed is written into the kernel entropy pool, but this may be "
"changed with I<$SYSTEMD_RANDOM_SEED_CREDIT>, see below\\&. On disk the "
"random seed is stored in /var/lib/systemd/random-seed\\&."

"Note that this service runs relatively late during the early boot phase, i"
"\\&.e\\&. generally after the initial RAM disk (initrd) completed its work, "
"and the /var/ file system has been mounted writable\\&. Many system services "
"require entropy much earlier than this \\(em this service is hence of "
"limited use for complex system\\&. It is recommended to use a boot loader "
"that can pass an initial random seed to the kernel to ensure that entropy is "
"available from earliest boot on, for example B<systemd-boot>(7), with its "
"B<bootctl random-seed> functionality\\&."

"When loading the random seed from disk, the file is immediately updated with "
"a new seed retrieved from the kernel, in order to ensure no two boots "
"operate with the same random seed\\&. This new seed is retrieved "
"synchronously from the kernel, which means the service will not complete "
"start-up until the random pool is fully initialized\\&. On entropy-starved "
"systems this may take a while\\&. This functionality is intended to be used "
"as synchronization point for ordering services that require an initialized "
"entropy pool to function securely (i\\&.e\\&. services that access /dev/"
"urandom without any further precautions)\\&."

"Care should be taken when creating OS images that are replicated to multiple "
"systems: if the random seed file is included unmodified each system will "
"initialize its entropy pool with the same data, and thus \\(em if otherwise "
"entropy-starved \\(em generate the same or at least guessable random seed "
"streams\\&. As a safety precaution crediting entropy is thus disabled by "
"default\\&. It is recommended to remove the random seed from OS images "
"intended for replication on multiple systems, in which case it is safe to "
"enable entropy crediting, see below\\&."
