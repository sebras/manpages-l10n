"The I<resizecons> command tries to change the videomode of the console.  "
"There are several aspects to this: (a) the kernel must know about it, (b) "
"the hardware must know about it, (c) user programs must know about it, (d) "
"the console font may have to be adapted."

"(a) The kernel is told about the change using the ioctl VT_RESIZE.  This "
"causes the kernel to reallocate console screen memory for all virtual "
"consoles, and might fail if there is not enough memory.  (In that case, try "
"to disallocate some virtual consoles first.)  If this ioctl succeeds, but a "
"later step fails (e.g., because you do not have root permissions), you may "
"be left with a very messy screen."

"The most difficult part of this is (b), since it requires detailed knowledge "
"of the video card hardware, and the setting of numerous registers. Only "
"changing the number of rows is slightly easier, and I<resizecons> will try "
"to do that itself, when given the I<-lines> option. (Probably, root "
"permission will be required.)  The command I<resizecons COLSxROWS> will "
"execute I<restoretextmode -r COLSxROWS> (and hence requires that you have "
"svgalib installed). Here COLSxROWS is a file that was created earlier by "
"I<restoretextmode -w COLSxROWS.> Again, either root permissions are "
"required, or I<restoretextmode> has to be suid root."

"In order to deal with (c), I<resizecons> does a `stty rows ROWS cols COLS' "
"for each active console (in the range tty0..tty15), and sends a SIGWINCH "
"signal to I<selection> if it finds the file /tmp/selection.pid."

"Finally, (d) is dealt with by executing a I<setfont> command. Most likely, "
