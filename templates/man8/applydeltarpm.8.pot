"applydeltarpm applies a binary delta to either an old rpm or to on-disk data "
"to re-create a new rpm. The old rpm can be specified with the B<-r> option, "
"if no rpm name is provided on-disk data is used. You can use B<-p> to make "
"applydeltarpm print the percentage of completion, or B<-v> to make it more "
"verbose about its operation."

"The second an third form can be used to check if the reconstruction is "
"possible. It may fail if the on-disk data got changed (deltarpms are created "
"in a way that config file changes do not matter) or the deltarpm does not "
"match the rpm the delta was generated with. The B<-c> option selects full (i."
"e. slow) on-disk checking, whereas B<-C> only checks if the filesizes have "
