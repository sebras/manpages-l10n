"fragiso can be used to convert an iso file into a fragment file, which is a "
"list describing all of the rpms on the iso and a data chunk containing "
"everything but the rpms. It is used by B<drpmsync> when an iso needs to be "
"transferred. The idea is that often the rpms on the iso are already "
"available on the destination host, so it saves bandwidth to first transfer "
"the fragmented iso, copy the locally available rpms, transfer the "
"unavailable rpms and reassemble the iso file."

"B<fragiso> B<make> converts the iso into the fragment iso, B<fragiso> "
"B<list> can be used to extract the rpm information. This information "
"consists of the offset and length of all rpms and the lead/signature header "
"md5sum plus the header/payload md5sum. To reassemble the iso one has to copy "
"the rpms at the right offset into a new file and then use B<fragiso> B<fill> "
"later on to provide all data not contained in the rpms. The B<-m> option "
"tells fragiso to print the resulting md5sum of the iso to stdout.  It can be "
"used for verification purposes."
