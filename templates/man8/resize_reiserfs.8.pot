"The B<resize_reiserfs> tool resizes an unmounted reiserfs file system.  It "
"enlarges or shrinks an reiserfs file system located on a I<device> so that "
"it will have I<size> bytes or size=old_size +(-)  I<size> bytes if the + or "
"- prefix is used.  If the B<-s> option is not specified, the filesystem will "
"be resized to fill the given device.  The I<size> parameter may have one of "
"the optional modifiers B<K>, B<M>, B<G>, which means the I<size> parameter "
"is given in kilo-, mega-, gigabytes respectively."

"The B<resize_reiserfs> program does not manipulate the size of the device. "
"If you wish to enlarge a filesystem, you must make sure you expand the "
"underlying device first. This can be done using B<cfdisk>(8)  for "
"partitions, by deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size "
"(assuming there is free space I<after> the partition in question).  Make "
"sure you re-create it with the same starting disk cylinder as before! "
"Otherwise, the resize operation will certainly not work, and you may lose "
