"B<mkfs.fat> is used to create a FAT filesystem on a device or in an image "
"file.  I<DEVICE> is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g. /dev/"
"sdXX) or the image file (which does not need to exist when the option B<-C> "
"is given).  I<BLOCK-COUNT> is the number of blocks on the device and size of "
"one block is always 1024 bytes, independently of the sector size or the "
"cluster size.  Therefore I<BLOCK-COUNT> specifies size of filesystem in KiB "
"unit and not in the number of sectors (like for all other B<mkfs.fat> "
"options).  If omitted, B<mkfs.fat> automatically chooses a filesystem size "
"to fill the available space."

"Two different variants of the FAT filesystem are supported.  Standard is the "
"FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 filesystems as defined by Microsoft and widely used "

"In Atari mode, if not directed otherwise by the user, B<mkfs.fat> will "
"always use 2 sectors per cluster, since GEMDOS doesn't like other values "
"very much.  It will also obey the maximum number of sectors GEMDOS can "
"handle.  Larger filesystems are managed by raising the logical sector size.  "
"An Atari-compatible serial number for the filesystem is generated, and a 12 "
"bit FAT is used only for filesystems that have one of the usual floppy sizes "
"(720k, 1.2M, 1.44M, 2.88M), a 16 bit FAT otherwise.  This can be overridden "
"with the B<-F> option.  Some PC-specific boot sector fields aren't written, "

"Use Atari variation of the MS-DOS filesystem.  This is default if B<mkfs."
"fat> is run on an Atari, then this option turns off Atari format.  There are "
"some differences when using Atari format: If not directed otherwise by the "
"user, B<mkfs.fat> will always use 2 sectors per cluster, since GEMDOS "
"doesn't like other values very much.  It will also obey the maximum number "
"of sectors GEMDOS can handle.  Larger filesystems are managed by raising the "
"logical sector size.  Under Atari format, an Atari-compatible serial number "
"for the filesystem is generated, and a 12 bit FAT is used only for "
"filesystems that have one of the usual floppy sizes (720k, 1.2M, 1.44M, "
"2.88M), a 16 bit FAT otherwise.  This can be overridden with the B<-F> "
"option.  Some PC-specific boot sector fields aren't written, and a boot "
"message (option B<-m>) is ignored."
