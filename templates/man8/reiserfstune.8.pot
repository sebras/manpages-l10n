"B<reiserfstune> is used for tuning the ReiserFS. It can change two journal "
"parameters (the journal size and the maximum transaction size), and it can "
"move the journal's location to a new specified block device. (The old "
"ReiserFS's journal may be kept unused, or discarded at the user's option.) "
"Besides that B<reiserfstune> can store the bad block list to the ReiserFS "
"and set UUID and LABEL.  Note: At the time of writing the relocated journal "
"was implemented for a special release of ReiserFS, and was not expected to "
"be put into the mainstream kernel until approximately Linux 2.5.  This means "
"that if you have the stock kernel you must apply a special patch. Without "
"this patch the kernel will refuse to mount the newly modified file system.  "
"We will charge $25 to explain this to you if you ask us why it doesn't work."
