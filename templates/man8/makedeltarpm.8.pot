"makedeltarpm creates a deltarpm from two rpms. The deltarpm can later be "

"the B<-v> option to make makedeltarpm more verbose about its work (use it "
"twice to make it even more verbose)."

"with the size of the created deltarpm. Furthermore, the uncompressed "
"deltarpm payload is currently also stored in memory when this option is "
"used, but it tends to be small in most cases."
