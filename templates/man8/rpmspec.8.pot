msgid ""
"B<rpmspec> is a tool for querying a spec file. More specifically for "
"querying hypothetical packages which would be created from the given spec "
"file. So querying a spec file with B<rpmspec> is similar to querying a "
"package built from that spec file. But is is not identical. With B<rpmspec> "
"you can't query all fields which you can query from a built package. E. g. "
"you can't query BUILDTIME with B<rpmspec> for obvious reasons. You also "
"cannot query other fields automatically generated during a build of a "
"package like auto generated dependencies."
