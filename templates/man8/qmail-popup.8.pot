"B<qmail-popup> expects descriptor 0 to read from the network and descriptor "
"1 to write to the network.  It reads a username and password from descriptor "
"0 in POP's USER-PASS style or APOP style.  It invokes I<subprogram>, with "
"the same descriptors 0 and 1; descriptor 2 writing to the network; and "
"descriptor 3 reading the username, a 0 byte, the password, another 0 byte, "
"an APOP timestamp derived from I<hostname>, and a final 0 byte.  B<qmail-"
