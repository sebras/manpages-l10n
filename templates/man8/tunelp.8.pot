"B<tunelp> sets several parameters for the /dev/lpI<?> devices, for better "
"performance (or for any performance at all, if your printer won't work "
"without it...) Without parameters, it tells whether the device is using "
"interrupts, and if so, which one.  With parameters, it sets the device "
"characteristics accordingly."
