"B<quotacheck> examines each filesystem, builds a table of current disk "
"usage, and compares this table against that recorded in the disk quota file "
"for the filesystem (this step is omitted if option B<-c> is specified). If "
"any inconsistencies are detected, both the quota file and the current system "
"copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the latter only occurs if an "
"active filesystem is checked which is not advised).  By default, only user "
"quotas are checked.  B<quotacheck> expects each filesystem to be checked to "
"have quota files named I<[a]quota.user> and I<[a]quota.group> located at the "
"root of the associated filesystem.  If a file is not present, B<quotacheck> "
"will create it."

"also be provided from command line (see option B<-n>)  , which is useful "
"when B<quotacheck> is run automatically (ie. from script) and failure is "

"It is strongly recommended to run B<quotacheck> with quotas turned off for "
"the filesystem. Otherwise, possible damage or loss to data in the quota "
"files can result.  It is also unwise to run B<quotacheck> on a live "
"filesystem as actual usage may change during the scan.  To prevent this, "
"B<quotacheck> tries to remount the filesystem read-only before starting the "
"scan.  After the scan is done it remounts the filesystem read-write. You can "
"disable this with option B<-m>.  You can also make B<quotacheck> ignore the "
"failure to remount the filesystem read-only with option B<-M>."
