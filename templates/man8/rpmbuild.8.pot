"B<rpmbuild> is used to build both binary and source software packages.  A "
"B<package> consists of an archive of files and meta-data used to install and "
"erase the archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file "
"attributes, and descriptive information about the package.  B<Packages> come "
"in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be "
"installed, and source packages, containing the source code and recipe "
"necessary to produce binary packages."
