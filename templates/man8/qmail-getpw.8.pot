"In B<qmail>, each user controls a vast array of local addresses.  B<qmail-"
"getpw> finds the user that controls a particular address, I<local>.  It "
"prints six pieces of information, each terminated by NUL: I<user>; I<uid>; "
"I<gid>; I<homedir>; I<dash>; and I<ext>.  The user's account name is "
"I<user>; the user's uid and gid in decimal are I<uid> and I<gid>; the user's "
"home directory is I<homedir>; and messages to I<local> will be handled by "
"I<homedir>B</.qmail>I<dashext>."
