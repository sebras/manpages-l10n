"systemd-gpt-auto-generator is a unit generator that automatically discovers "

"Extended Boot Loader Partition and swap partitions and creates mount and "

"chapter 5\\&. It implements the \\m[blue]B<Discoverable Partitions "
"Specification>\\m[]\\&\\s-2\\u[2]\\d\\s+2\\&. Note that this generator has "
"no effect on non-GPT systems, and on specific mount points that are "
