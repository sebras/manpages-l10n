"The usual PC keyboard produces a series of scancodes for each key press and "
"key release. (Scancodes are shown by B<showkey -s>, see B<showkey>(1)  ) The "
"kernel parses this stream of scancodes, and converts it to a stream of "
"keycodes (key press/release events).  (Keycodes are shown by B<showkey>.)  "
"Apart from a few scancodes with special meaning, and apart from the sequence "
"produced by the Pause key, and apart from shiftstate related scancodes, and "
"apart from the key up/down bit, the stream of scancodes consists of "
"unescaped scancodes xx (7 bits) and escaped scancodes e0 xx (8+7 bits).  To "
"these scancodes or scancode pairs, a corresponding keycode can be assigned "
"(in the range 1-127).  For example, if you have a Macro key that produces e0 "
