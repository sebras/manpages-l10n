"B<badblocks> is used to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a disk "
"partition).  I<device> is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g "
"I</dev/hdc1>).  I<last_block> is the last block to be checked; if it is not "
"specified, the last block on the device is used as a default.  "
"I<first_block> is an optional parameter specifying the starting block number "
"for the test, which allows the testing to start in the middle of the disk.  "
"If it is not specified the first block on the disk is used as a default."

"B<Important note:> If the output of B<badblocks> is going to be fed to the "
"B<e2fsck> or B<mke2fs> programs, it is important that the block size is "
"properly specified, since the block numbers which are generated are very "
"dependent on the block size in use by the filesystem.  For this reason, it "
"is strongly recommended that users B<not> run B<badblocks> directly, but "
"rather use the B<-c> option of the B<e2fsck> and B<mke2fs> programs."
