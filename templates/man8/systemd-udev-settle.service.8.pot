"This service calls B<udevadm settle> to wait until all events that have been "
"queued by B<udev>(7)  have been processed\\&. It is a crude way to wait "
"until \"all\" hardware has been discovered\\&. Services may pull in this "
"service and order themselves after it to wait for the udev queue to be "
"empty\\&."

"I<Using this service is not recommended\\&.> There can be no guarantee that "
"hardware is fully discovered at any specific time, because the kernel does "
"hardware detection asynchronously, and certain buses and devices take a very "
"long time to become ready, and also additional hardware may be plugged in at "
"any time\\&. Instead, services should subscribe to udev events and react to "
"any new hardware as it is discovered\\&. Services that, based on "
"configuration, expect certain devices to appear, may warn or report failure "
"after a timeout\\&. This timeout should be tailored to the hardware type\\&. "
"Waiting for systemd-udev-settle\\&.service usually slows boot significantly, "
"because it means waiting for all unrelated events too\\&."
