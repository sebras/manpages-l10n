"Note that TTY logins generally do not support re-authentication on system "

"authentication mechanism and console logins that do not, the home directory "

"logs in on another virtual terminal (regardless if via another TTY session "
"or graphically) which will resume the home directory and unblock the "
"original TTY session\\&. (Do note that lack of screen locking on TTY "
"sessions means even though the TTY session appears hung, keypresses can "
"still be queued into it, and the existing screen contents be read without re-"
