"This tool implements file, directory, or partition based update schemes, "
"supporting multiple parallel installed versions of specific resources in an "
"A/B (or even: A/B/C, A/B/C/D/, \\&...) style\\&. A/B updating means that "
"when one version of a resource is currently being used, the next version can "
"be downloaded, unpacked, and prepared in an entirely separate location, "
"independently of the first, and \\(em once complete \\(em be activated, "
"swapping the roles so that it becomes the used one and the previously used "
"one becomes the one that is replaced by the next update, and so on\\&. The "
"resources to update are defined in transfer files, one for each resource to "
"be updated\\&. For example, resources that may be updated with this tool "
"could be: a root file system partition, a matching Verity partition plus one "
"kernel image\\&. The combination of the three would be considered a complete "
"OS update\\&."

"The tool updates partitions, files or directory trees always in whole, and "
"operates with at least two versions of each of these resources: the "
"I<current> version, plus the I<next> version: the one that is being updated "
"to, and which is initially incomplete as the downloaded data is written to "
"it; plus optionally more versions\\&. Once the download of a newer version "
"is complete it becomes the current version, releasing the version previously "
