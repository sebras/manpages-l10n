"B<e2scrub> attempts to check (but not repair) all metadata in a mounted "

"This program snapshots the volume and runs a file system check on the "
"snapshot to look for corruption errors.  The LVM volume group must have at "
"least 256MiB of unallocated space to dedicate to the snapshot or the logical "
"volume will be skipped.  The snapshot will be named I<lvname>.e2scrub and "
"B<udev> will not create symbolic links to it under I</dev/disk>.  Every "
"attempt will be made to remove the snapshots prior to running B<e2scrub>, "
"but in a dire situation it may be necessary to remove the snapshot manually."

"If no errors are found, B<fstrim> can be called on the file system if it is "
"mounted.  If errors are found, the file system will be marked as having "
"errors.  The file system should be taken offline and B<e2fsck> run as soon "
"as possible, because B<e2scrub> does not fix corruptions.  If the file "
"system is not repaired, B<e2fsck> will be run before the next mount."
