"B<Iwspy> is used to set a list of addresses to monitor in a wireless network "
"interface and to read back quality of link information for each of those. "
"This information is the same as the one available in I</proc/net/wireless> : "
"quality of the link, signal strength and noise level."

"Note that this functionality works only for nodes part of the current "
"wireless cell, you can not monitor Access Points you are not associated with "
"(you can use Scanning for that) and nodes in other cells. In Managed mode, "
"in most case packets are relayed by the Access Point, in this case you will "
"get the signal strength of the Access Point. For those reasons this "
"functionality is mostly useful in Ad-Hoc and Master mode."
