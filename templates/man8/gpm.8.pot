"This package tries to be a useful mouse server for applications running on "
"the Linux console.  It is based on the \"selection\" package, and some of "
"its code comes from selection itself. This package is intended as a "
"replacement for \"selection\" as a cut-and-paste mechanism; it also provides "
"additional facilities. The \"selection\" package offered the first cut-and-"
"paste implementation for Linux using two mouse buttons, and the cut buffer "
"is still called \"selection buffer\" or just \"selection\" throughout this "
"document.  The information below is extracted from the texinfo file, which "
