"The B<resize2fs> program will resize ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.  It "
"can be used to enlarge or shrink an unmounted file system located on "
"I<device>.  If the file system is mounted, it can be used to expand the size "
"of the mounted file system, assuming the kernel and the file system supports "
"on-line resizing.  (Modern Linux 2.6 kernels will support on-line resize for "
"file systems mounted using ext3 and ext4; ext3 file systems will require the "
"use of file systems with the resize_inode feature enabled.)"
