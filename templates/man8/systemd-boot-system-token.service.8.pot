"systemd-boot-system-token\\&.service is a system service that automatically "
"generates a \\*(Aqsystem token\\*(Aq to store in an EFI variable in the "
"system\\*(Aqs NVRAM and a random seed to store on the EFI System Partition "
"ESP on disk\\&. The boot loader may then combine these two randomized data "
"fields by cryptographic hashing, and pass it to the OS it boots as "
"initialization seed for its entropy pool\\&. The random seed stored in the "
"ESP is refreshed on each reboot ensuring that multiple subsequent boots will "
"boot with different seeds\\&. The \\*(Aqsystem token\\*(Aq is generated "
"randomly once, and then persistently stored in the system\\*(Aqs EFI "
"variable storage\\&."
