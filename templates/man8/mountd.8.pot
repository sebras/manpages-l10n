"The B<rpc.mountd> daemon implements the server side of the NFS MOUNT "

"The NFS server (I<nfsd>)  maintains a cache of authentication and "
"authorization information which is used to identify the source of each "
"request, and then what access permissions that source has to any local "

"sends a request to B<mountd> to fill in the missing information.  Mountd "
"uses a table of information stored in B</var/lib/nfs/etab> and maintained by "
