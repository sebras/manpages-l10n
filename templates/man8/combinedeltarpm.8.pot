"combinedeltarpm normally produces a V3 format deltarpm, use the B<-V> option "
"to specify a different version if desired. The B<-z> option can be used to "
"specify a different compression method, the default is to use the same "
"compression method as used in the last of the old deltarpms."

"If you want to use a different header signature you can also specify a rpm "

"feature can be used to if a deltarpm was made against an unsigned rpm which "
