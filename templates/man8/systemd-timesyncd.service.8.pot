"systemd-timesyncd is a system service that may be used to synchronize the "
"local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server\\&. It "
"also saves the local time to disk every time the clock has been synchronized "
"and uses this to possibly advance the system realtime clock on subsequent "
"reboots to ensure it (roughly) monotonically advances even if the system "
"lacks a battery-buffered RTC chip\\&."

"The systemd-timesyncd service implements SNTP only\\&. This minimalistic "
"service will step the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for "
"smaller deltas\\&. Complex use cases that require full NTP support (and "
"where SNTP is not sufficient) are not covered by systemd-timesyncd\\&."
