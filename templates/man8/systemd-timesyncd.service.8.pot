"systemd-timesyncd is a system service that may be used to synchronize the "
"local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server\\&. It "
"also saves the local time to disk every time the clock has been synchronized "
"and uses this to possibly advance the system realtime clock on subsequent "
"reboots to ensure it (roughly) monotonically advances even if the system "
"lacks a battery-buffered RTC chip\\&."
