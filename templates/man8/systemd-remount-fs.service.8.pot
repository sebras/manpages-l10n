"systemd-remount-fs\\&.service is an early boot service that applies mount "
"options listed in B<fstab>(5), or gathered from the partition table (when "
"B<systemd-gpt-auto-generator>(8)  is active) to the root file system, the /"
"usr/ file system, and the kernel API file systems\\&. This is required so "
"that the mount options of these file systems \\(em which are pre-mounted by "
"the kernel, the initial RAM disk, container environments or system manager "
"code \\(em are updated to those configured in /etc/fstab and the other "
"sources\\&. This service ignores normal file systems and only changes the "
"root file system (i\\&.e\\&.  /), /usr/, and the virtual kernel API file "
"systems such as /proc/, /sys/ or /dev/\\&. This service executes no "
"operation if no configuration is found (/etc/fstab does not exist or lists "
"no entries for the mentioned file systems, or the partition table does not "
"contain relevant entries)\\&."
