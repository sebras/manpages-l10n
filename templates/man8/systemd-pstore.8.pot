"systemd-pstore\\&.service is a system service that archives the contents of "
"the Linux persistent storage filesystem, pstore, to other storage, thus "
"preserving the existing information contained in the pstore, and clearing "
"pstore storage for future error events\\&."

"Linux provides a persistent storage file system, pstore, that can store "
"error records when the kernel dies (or reboots or powers-off)\\&. These "
"records in turn can be referenced to debug kernel problems (currently the "
"kernel stuffs the tail of the dmesg, which also contains a stack backtrace, "
"into pstore)\\&."

"The pstore file system supports a variety of backends that map onto "
"persistent storage, such as the ACPI ERST and UEFI variables\\&. The pstore "
"backends typically offer a relatively small amount of persistent storage, e"
"\\&.g\\&. 64KiB, which can quickly fill up and thus prevent subsequent "
"kernel crashes from recording errors\\&. Thus there is a need to monitor and "
"extract the pstore contents so that future kernel problems can also record "
"information in the pstore\\&."

"The pstore service is independent of the kdump service\\&. In cloud "
"environments specifically, host and guest filesystems are on remote "
"filesystems (eg\\&. iSCSI or NFS), thus kdump relies [implicitly and/or "
"explicitly] upon proper operation of networking software *and* hardware "
"*and* infrastructure\\&. Thus it may not be possible to capture a kernel "
"coredump to a file since writes over the network may not be possible\\&."

"The pstore backend, on the other hand, is completely local and provides a "
"path to store error records which will survive a reboot and aid in post-"
"mortem debugging\\&."
