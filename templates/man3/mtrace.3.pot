#.  FIXME: The marking is different from that in the glibc manual,

#.       muntrace: MT-Unsafe race:mtrace const:malloc_hooks locale
#.  But there is something wrong in glibc manual, for example:
#.  glibc manual says muntrace should have marking locale because it calls
#.  fprintf(), but muntrace does not execute area which cause locale problem.
