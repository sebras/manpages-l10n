"In early filesystems, the value returned by B<telldir>()  was a simple file "
"offset within a directory.  Modern filesystems use tree or hash structures, "
"rather than flat tables, to represent directories.  On such filesystems, the "
"value returned by B<telldir>()  (and used internally by B<readdir>(3))  is a "
"\"cookie\" that is used by the implementation to derive a position within a "
"directory.  Application programs should treat this strictly as an opaque "
