"The B<open_memstream>()  function opens a stream for writing to a memory "
"buffer.  The function dynamically allocates the buffer, and the buffer "
"automatically grows as needed.  Initially, the buffer has a size of zero.  "
"After closing the stream, the caller should B<free>(3)  this buffer."

"The locations pointed to by I<ptr> and I<sizeloc> are used to report, "
"respectively, the current location and the size of the buffer.  The "
"locations referred to by these pointers are updated each time the stream is "
"flushed (B<fflush>(3))  and when the stream is closed (B<fclose>(3)).  These "
"values remain valid only as long as the caller performs no further output on "
"the stream.  If further output is performed, then the stream must again be "
"flushed before trying to access these values."
