"Reads and writes may be intermixed on read/write streams in any order.  Note "
"that ANSI C requires that a file positioning function intervene between "
"output and input, unless an input operation encounters end-of-file.  (If "
"this condition is not met, then a read is allowed to return the result of "
"writes other than the most recent.)  Therefore it is good practice (and "
"indeed sometimes necessary under Linux) to put an B<fseek>(3)  or "
"B<fgetpos>(3)  operation between write and read operations on such a "
"stream.  This operation may be an apparent no-op (as in I<fseek(..., 0L, "
"SEEK_CUR)> called for its synchronizing side effect)."
