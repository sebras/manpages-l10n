#.  .SH HISTORY
#.  UNIX V7 defines the three routines
#.  .BR printf (),
#.  .BR fprintf (),
#.  .BR sprintf (),
#.  and has the flag \-, the width or precision *, the length modifier l,
#.  and the conversions doxfegcsu, and also D,O,U,X as synonyms for ld,lo,lu,lx.
#.  This is still true for 2.9.1BSD, but 2.10BSD has the flags
#.  #, + and <space> and no longer mentions D,O,U,X.
#.  2.11BSD has
#.  .BR vprintf (),
#.  .BR vfprintf (),
#.  .BR vsprintf (),
#.  and warns not to use D,O,U,X.
#.  4.3BSD Reno has the flag 0, the length modifiers h and L,
#.  and the conversions n, p, E, G, X (with current meaning)
#.  and deprecates D,O,U.
#.  4.4BSD introduces the functions
#.  .BR snprintf ()
#.  and
#.  .BR vsnprintf (),
#.  and the length modifier q.
#.  FreeBSD also has functions
#.  .BR asprintf ()
#.  and
#.  .BR vasprintf (),
#.  that allocate a buffer large enough for
#.  .BR sprintf ().
#.  In glibc there are functions
#.  .BR dprintf ()
#.  and
#.  .BR vdprintf ()
#.  that print to a file descriptor instead of a stream.
