"The stdio functions are thread-safe.  This is achieved by assigning to each "
"I<FILE> object a lockcount and (if the lockcount is nonzero)  an owning "
"thread.  For each library call, these functions wait until the I<FILE> "
"object is no longer locked by a different thread, then lock it, do the "
"requested I/O, and unlock the object again."

"All this is invisible to the C-programmer, but there may be two reasons to "
"wish for more detailed control.  On the one hand, maybe a series of I/O "

"I/O of some other thread.  On the other hand, maybe the locking overhead "
"should be avoided for greater efficiency."
