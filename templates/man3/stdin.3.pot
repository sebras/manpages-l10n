"Under normal circumstances every UNIX program has three streams opened for "
"it when it starts up, one for input, one for output, and one for printing "
"diagnostic or error messages.  These are typically attached to the user's "
"terminal (see B<tty>(4))  but might instead refer to files or other devices, "
"depending on what the parent process chose to set up.  (See also the "
"\"Redirection\" section of B<sh>(1).)"

"Note that mixing use of I<FILE>s and raw file descriptors can produce "

"among you: POSIX.1, section 8.2.3, describes in detail how this interaction "
"is supposed to work.)  A general rule is that file descriptors are handled "
"in the kernel, while stdio is just a library.  This means for example, that "
"after an B<exec>(3), the child inherits all open file descriptors, but all "
"old streams have become inaccessible."

"The stream I<stderr> is unbuffered.  The stream I<stdout> is line-buffered "
"when it points to a terminal.  Partial lines will not appear until "
"B<fflush>(3)  or B<exit>(3)  is called, or a newline is printed.  This can "
"produce unexpected results, especially with debugging output.  The buffering "
"mode of the standard streams (or any other stream)  can be changed using the "
"B<setbuf>(3)  or B<setvbuf>(3)  call.  Note that in case I<stdin> is "
"associated with a terminal, there may also be input buffering in the "
"terminal driver, entirely unrelated to stdio buffering.  (Indeed, normally "
"terminal input is line buffered in the kernel.)  This kernel input handling "
"can be modified using calls like B<tcsetattr>(3); see also B<stty>(1), and "
