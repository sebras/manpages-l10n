"Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from the specified set of accepted "
"characters; the next pointer must be a pointer to I<char>, and there must be "
"enough room for all the characters in the string, plus a terminating null "
"byte.  The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed.  The string is "
"to be made up of characters in (or not in) a particular set; the set is "
"defined by the characters between the open bracket B<[> character and a "
"close bracket B<]> character.  The set I<excludes> those characters if the "
"first character after the open bracket is a circumflex (B<^>).  To include a "
"close bracket in the set, make it the first character after the open bracket "
"or the circumflex; any other position will end the set.  The hyphen "
"character B<-> is also special; when placed between two other characters, it "
"adds all intervening characters to the set.  To include a hyphen, make it "
"the last character before the final close bracket.  For instance, "
"B<[^]0-9-]> means the set \"everything except close bracket, zero through "
"nine, and hyphen\".  The string ends with the appearance of a character not "
"in the (or, with a circumflex, in) set or when the field width runs out."
