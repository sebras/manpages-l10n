"B<ecb_crypt>()  and B<cbc_crypt>()  implement the NBS DES (Data Encryption "
"Standard).  These routines are faster and more general purpose than "
"B<crypt>(3).  They also are able to utilize DES hardware if it is "
"available.  B<ecb_crypt>()  encrypts in ECB (Electronic Code Book)  mode, "
"which encrypts blocks of data independently.  B<cbc_crypt>()  encrypts in "
"CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)  mode, which chains together successive blocks.  "
"CBC mode protects against insertions, deletions, and substitutions of "
"blocks.  Also, regularities in the clear text will not appear in the cipher "
"text."

"Here is how to use these routines.  The first argument, I<key>, is the 8-"
"byte encryption key with parity.  To set the key's parity, which for DES is "
"in the low bit of each byte, use B<des_setparity>().  The second argument, "
"I<data>, contains the data to be encrypted or decrypted.  The third "
"argument, I<datalen>, is the length in bytes of I<data>, which must be a "
"multiple of 8.  The fourth argument, I<mode>, is formed by ORing together "
"some things.  For the encryption direction OR in either B<DES_ENCRYPT> or "
"B<DES_DECRYPT>.  For software versus hardware encryption, OR in either "
"B<DES_HW> or B<DES_SW>.  If B<DES_HW> is specified, and there is no "
"hardware, then the encryption is performed in software and the routine "
"returns B<DESERR_NOHWDEVICE>.  For B<cbc_crypt>(), the argument I<ivec> is "
"the 8-byte initialization vector for the chaining.  It is updated to the "
"next initialization vector upon return."
