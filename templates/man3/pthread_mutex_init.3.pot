#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"A mutex is a MUTual EXclusion device, and is useful for protecting shared "
"data structures from concurrent modifications, and implementing critical "
"sections and monitors."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"A mutex has two possible states: unlocked (not owned by any thread), and "
"locked (owned by one thread). A mutex can never be owned by two different "
"threads simultaneously. A thread attempting to lock a mutex that is already "
"locked by another thread is suspended until the owning thread unlocks the "
"mutex first."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"B<pthread_mutex_init> initializes the mutex object pointed to by I<mutex> "
"according to the mutex attributes specified in I<mutexattr>.  If "
"I<mutexattr> is B<NULL>, default attributes are used instead."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"The LinuxThreads implementation supports only one mutex attributes, the "
"I<mutex kind>, which is either ``fast'', ``recursive'', or ``error "
"checking''. The kind of a mutex determines whether it can be locked again by "
"a thread that already owns it.  The default kind is ``fast''. See "
"B<pthread_mutexattr_init>(3) for more information on mutex attributes."

"Variables of type B<pthread_mutex_t> can also be initialized statically, "
"using the constants B<PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER> (for fast mutexes), "
"B<PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP> (for recursive mutexes), and "

"B<pthread_mutex_lock> locks the given mutex. If the mutex is currently "
"unlocked, it becomes locked and owned by the calling thread, and "
"B<pthread_mutex_lock> returns immediately. If the mutex is already locked by "

"mutex is unlocked."

"If the mutex is already locked by the calling thread, the behavior of "
"B<pthread_mutex_lock> depends on the kind of the mutex. If the mutex is of "
"the ``fast'' kind, the calling thread is suspended until the mutex is "
"unlocked, thus effectively causing the calling thread to deadlock. If the "
"mutex is of the ``error checking'' kind, B<pthread_mutex_lock> returns "
"immediately with the error code B<EDEADLK>.  If the mutex is of the "
"``recursive'' kind, B<pthread_mutex_lock> succeeds and returns immediately, "
"recording the number of times the calling thread has locked the mutex. An "
"equal number of B<pthread_mutex_unlock> operations must be performed before "
"the mutex returns to the unlocked state."

"B<pthread_mutex_trylock> behaves identically to B<pthread_mutex_lock>, "
"except that it does not block the calling thread if the mutex is already "

"mutex). Instead, B<pthread_mutex_trylock> returns immediately with the error "
"code B<EBUSY>."

"B<pthread_mutex_unlock> unlocks the given mutex. The mutex is assumed to be "
"locked and owned by the calling thread on entrance to "
"B<pthread_mutex_unlock>. If the mutex is of the ``fast'' kind, "
"B<pthread_mutex_unlock> always returns it to the unlocked state. If it is of "
"the ``recursive'' kind, it decrements the locking count of the mutex (number "
"of B<pthread_mutex_lock> operations performed on it by the calling thread), "

"it was locked by the same thread that is now calling "
"B<pthread_mutex_unlock>.  If these conditions are not met, an error code is "
"returned and the mutex remains unchanged.  ``Fast'' mutexes perform no such "
"checks, thus allowing a locked mutex to be unlocked by a thread other than "
"its owner. This is non-portable behavior and must not be relied upon."

"None of the mutex functions is a cancellation point, not even "
