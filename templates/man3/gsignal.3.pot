"Elsewhere, on System V-like systems, these functions implement software "
"signaling, entirely independent of the classical B<signal>(2)  and "
"B<kill>(2)  functions.  The function B<ssignal>()  defines the action to "
"take when the software signal with number I<signum> is raised using the "
"function B<gsignal>(), and returns the previous such action or B<SIG_DFL>.  "
"The function B<gsignal>()  does the following: if no action (or the action "
"B<SIG_DFL>)  was specified for I<signum>, then it does nothing and returns "
"0.  If the action B<SIG_IGN> was specified for I<signum>, then it does "
"nothing and returns 1.  Otherwise, it resets the action to B<SIG_DFL> and "
"calls the action function with argument I<signum>, and returns the value "
"returned by that function.  The range of possible values I<signum> varies "
"(often 1\\(en15 or 1\\(en17)."
