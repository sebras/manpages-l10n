"The B<libblkid> library is used to identify block devices (disks) as to "
"their content (e.g., filesystem type) as well as extracting additional "
"information such as filesystem labels/volume names, unique identifiers/"
"serial numbers. A common use is to allow use of B<LABEL=> and B<UUID=> tags "
"instead of hard-coding specific block device names into configuration files."

"The low-level part of the library also allows the extraction of information "
"about partitions and block device topology."

msgid ""
"The high-level part of the library keeps information about block devices in "
"a cache file and is verified to still be valid before being returned to the "
"user (if the user has read permission on the raw block device, otherwise "
"not). The cache file also allows unprivileged users (normally anyone other "
"than root, or those not in the \"disk\" group) to locate devices by label/"
"id. The standard location of the cache file can be overridden by the "
"environment variable B<BLKID_FILE>."

"In situations where one is getting information about a single known device, "

"are not able to read the block device directly)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"The high-level part of the library supports two methods to determine B<LABEL/"

"If you are dealing with multiple devices, use of the cache is highly "

"In some cases (modular kernels), block devices are not even visible until "
