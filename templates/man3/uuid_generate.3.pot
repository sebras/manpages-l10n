"The B<uuid_generate>() function creates a new universally unique identifier "
"(UUID). The uuid will be generated based on high-quality randomness from "
"B<getrandom>(2), I</dev/urandom>, or I</dev/random> if available. If it is "

"which uses the current time, the local ethernet MAC address (if available), "
"and random data generated using a pseudo-random generator."
