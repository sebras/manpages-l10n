#.  Here is the relevant wording:
#.      A thread may hold multiple concurrent read locks on rwlock (that is,
#.      successfully call the pthread_rwlock_rdlock() function n times). If
#.      so, the thread must perform matching unlocks (that is, it must call
#.      the pthread_rwlock_unlock() function n times).
#.  By making write-priority work correctly, I broke the above requirement,
#.  because I had no clue that recursive read locks are permissible.
#.  If a thread which holds a read lock tries to acquire another read lock,
#.  and now one or more writers is waiting for a write lock, then the algorithm
#.  will lead to an obvious deadlock. The reader will be suspended, waiting for
#.  the writers to acquire and release the lock, and the writers will be
#.  suspended waiting for every existing read lock to be released.
