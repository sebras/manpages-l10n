"The functions B<timelocal>()  and B<timegm>()  are the inverses of "
"B<localtime>(3)  and B<gmtime>(3).  Both functions take a broken-down time "
"and convert it to calendar time (seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 "
"00:00:00 +0000, UTC).  The difference between the two functions is that "
"B<timelocal>()  takes the local timezone into account when doing the "
"conversion, while B<timegm>()  takes the input value to be Coordinated "
"Universal Time (UTC)."
