"B<%G>, B<%g>, and B<%V> yield values calculated from the week-based year "
"defined by the ISO\\ 8601 standard.  In this system, weeks start on a "
"Monday, and are numbered from 01, for the first week, up to 52 or 53, for "
"the last week.  Week 1 is the first week where four or more days fall within "
"the new year (or, synonymously, week 01 is: the first week of the year that "
"contains a Thursday; or, the week that has 4 January in it).  When three of "
"fewer days of the first calendar week of the new year fall within that year, "
"then the ISO 8601 week-based system counts those days as part of week 53 of "
"the preceding year.  For example, 1 January 2010 is a Friday, meaning that "
"just three days of that calendar week fall in 2010.  Thus, the ISO\\ 8601 "
"week-based system considers these days to be part of week 53 (B<%V>)  of the "
"year 2009 (B<%G>); week 01 of ISO\\ 8601 year 2010 starts on Monday, 4 "
