"The B<malloc_stats>()  function prints (on standard error) statistics about "
"memory allocated by B<malloc>(3)  and related functions.  For each arena "
"(allocation area), this function prints the total amount of memory allocated "
"and the total number of bytes consumed by in-use allocations.  (These two "
"values correspond to the I<arena> and I<uordblks> fields retrieved by "
"B<mallinfo>(3).)  In addition, the function prints the sum of these two "
"statistics for all arenas, and the maximum number of blocks and bytes that "
"were ever simultaneously allocated using B<mmap>(2)."
