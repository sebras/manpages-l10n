"B<backtrace>()  returns a backtrace for the calling program, in the array "
"pointed to by I<buffer>.  A backtrace is the series of currently active "
"function calls for the program.  Each item in the array pointed to by "
"I<buffer> is of type I<void\\ *>, and is the return address from the "
"corresponding stack frame.  The I<size> argument specifies the maximum "
"number of addresses that can be stored in I<buffer>.  If the backtrace is "
"larger than I<size>, then the addresses corresponding to the I<size> most "
"recent function calls are returned; to obtain the complete backtrace, make "
"sure that I<buffer> and I<size> are large enough."

"hexadecimal).  The address of the array of string pointers is returned as "
"the function result of B<backtrace_symbols>().  This array is B<malloc>(3)ed "
