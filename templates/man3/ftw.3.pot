"According to POSIX.1-2008, when the I<typeflag> argument passed to I<fn>()  "
"contains B<FTW_SLN>, the buffer pointed to by I<sb> should contain "
"information about the dangling symbolic link (obtained by calling "
"B<lstat>(2)  on the link).  Early glibc versions correctly followed the "
"POSIX specification on this point.  However, as a result of a regression "
"introduced in glibc 2.4, the contents of the buffer pointed to by I<sb> were "
"undefined when B<FTW_SLN> is passed in I<typeflag>.  (More precisely, the "
"contents of the buffer were left unchanged in this case.)  This regression "
"was eventually fixed in glibc 2.30, so that the glibc implementation (once "
"more) follows the POSIX specification."
