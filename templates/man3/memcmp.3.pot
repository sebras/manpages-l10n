"Do not use B<memcmp>()  to compare security critical data, such as "
"cryptographic secrets, because the required CPU time depends on the number "
"of equal bytes.  Instead, a function that performs comparisons in constant "
"time is required.  Some operating systems provide such a function (e.g., "
"NetBSD's B<consttime_memequal>()), but no such function is specified in "
"POSIX.  On Linux, it may be necessary to implement such a function oneself."
