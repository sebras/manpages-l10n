"Character conversion between the multibyte representation and the wide "
"character representation uses conversion state, of type I<mbstate_t>.  "
"Conversion of a string uses a finite-state machine; when it is interrupted "
"after the complete conversion of a number of characters, it may need to save "
"a state for processing the remaining characters.  Such a conversion state is "
"needed for the sake of encodings such as ISO-2022 and UTF-7."
