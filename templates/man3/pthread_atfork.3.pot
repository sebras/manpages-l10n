"When B<fork>(2)  is called in a multithreaded process, only the calling "
"thread is duplicated in the child process.  The original intention of "
"B<pthread_atfork>()  was to allow the calling thread to be returned to a "
"consistent state.  For example, at the time of the call to B<fork>(2), other "
"threads may have locked mutexes that are visible in the user-space memory "
"duplicated in the child.  Such mutexes would never be unlocked, since the "
"threads that placed the locks are not duplicated in the child.  The intent "
"of B<pthread_atfork>()  was to provide a mechanism whereby the application "
"(or a library)  could ensure that mutexes and other process and thread state "
"would be restored to a consistent state.  In practice, this task is "
"generally too difficult to be practicable."
