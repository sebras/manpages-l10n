"These routines allow C programs to make procedure calls on other machines "
"across the network.  First, the client calls a procedure to send a data "
"packet to the server.  Upon receipt of the packet, the server calls a "
"dispatch routine to perform the requested service, and then sends back a "
"reply.  Finally, the procedure call returns to the client."
