"The main case for this function is when I<s> is not NULL and I<pwc> is not "
"NULL.  In this case, the B<mbtowc>()  function inspects at most I<n> bytes "
"of the multibyte string starting at I<s>, extracts the next complete "
"multibyte character, converts it to a wide character and stores it at "
"I<*pwc>.  It updates an internal shift state known only to the B<mbtowc>()  "
"function.  If I<s> does not point to a null byte (\\(aq\\e0\\(aq), it "
"returns the number of bytes that were consumed from I<s>, otherwise it "
"returns 0."
