"Condition attributes can be specified at condition creation time, by passing "
"a condition attribute object as second argument to B<pthread_cond_init>(3).  "
"Passing B<NULL> is equivalent to passing a condition attribute object with "
"all attributes set to their default values."

"The LinuxThreads implementation supports no attributes for conditions. The "
"functions on condition attributes are included only for compliance with the "
"POSIX standard."

"B<pthread_condattr_init> initializes the condition attribute object I<attr> "
"and fills it with default values for the attributes.  "
"B<pthread_condattr_destroy> destroys a condition attribute object, which "
"must not be reused until it is reinitialized. Both functions do nothing in "
"the LinuxThreads implementation."
