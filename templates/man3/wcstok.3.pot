"The B<wcstok>()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the "
"B<strtok>(3)  function, with an added argument to make it multithread-safe.  "
"It can be used to split a wide-character string I<wcs> into tokens, where a "
"token is defined as a substring not containing any wide-characters from "
"I<delim>."

"The search starts at I<wcs>, if I<wcs> is not NULL, or at I<*ptr>, if I<wcs> "
"is NULL.  First, any delimiter wide-characters are skipped, that is, the "
"pointer is advanced beyond any wide-characters which occur in I<delim>.  If "
"the end of the wide-character string is now reached, B<wcstok>()  returns "
"NULL, to indicate that no tokens were found, and stores an appropriate value "
"in I<*ptr>, so that subsequent calls to B<wcstok>()  will continue to return "
"NULL.  Otherwise, the B<wcstok>()  function recognizes the beginning of a "
"token and returns a pointer to it, but before doing that, it zero-terminates "
"the token by replacing the next wide-character which occurs in I<delim> with "
"a null wide character (L\\(aq\\e0\\(aq), and it updates I<*ptr> so that "
"subsequent calls will continue searching after the end of recognized token."
