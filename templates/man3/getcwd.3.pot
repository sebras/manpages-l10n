"Since a Linux 2.6.36 change that added \"(unreachable)\", the glibc "
"B<getcwd>()  has failed to conform to POSIX and returned a relative path "
"when the API contract requires an absolute path.  With glibc 2.27 onwards "
"this is corrected; calling B<getcwd>()  from such a path will now result in "
"failure with B<ENOENT>."
