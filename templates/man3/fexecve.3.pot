"The idea behind B<fexecve>()  is to allow the caller to verify (checksum) "

"The natural idiom when using B<fexecve>()  is to set the close-on-exec flag "
"on I<fd>, so that the file descriptor does not leak through to the program "
"that is executed.  This approach is natural for two reasons.  First, it "
"prevents file descriptors being consumed unnecessarily.  (The executed "
"program normally has no need of a file descriptor that refers to the program "
"itself.)  Second, if B<fexecve>()  is used recursively, employing the close-"
"on-exec flag prevents the file descriptor exhaustion that would result from "
"the fact that each step in the recursion would cause one more file "
"descriptor to be passed to the new program.  (But see BUGS.)"
