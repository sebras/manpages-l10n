"Failure to observe the requirement that the memory areas do not overlap has "
"been the source of significant bugs.  (POSIX and the C standards are "
"explicit that employing B<memcpy>()  with overlapping areas produces "
"undefined behavior.)  Most notably, in glibc 2.13 a performance optimization "
"of B<memcpy>()  on some platforms (including x86-64) included changing the "
"order in which bytes were copied from I<src> to I<dest>."

"This change revealed breakages in a number of applications that performed "
"copying with overlapping areas.  Under the previous implementation, the "
"order in which the bytes were copied had fortuitously hidden the bug, which "
"was revealed when the copying order was reversed.  In glibc 2.14, a "
"versioned symbol was added so that old binaries (i.e., those linked against "
"glibc versions earlier than 2.14)  employed a B<memcpy>()  implementation "
"that safely handles the overlapping buffers case (by providing an \"older\" "
"B<memcpy>()  implementation that was aliased to B<memmove>(3))."
