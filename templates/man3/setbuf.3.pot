"The three types of buffering available are unbuffered, block buffered, and "
"line buffered.  When an output stream is unbuffered, information appears on "
"the destination file or terminal as soon as written; when it is block "
"buffered, many characters are saved up and written as a block; when it is "
"line buffered, characters are saved up until a newline is output or input is "
"read from any stream attached to a terminal device (typically I<stdin>).  "
"The function B<fflush>(3)  may be used to force the block out early.  (See "
"B<fclose>(3).)"
