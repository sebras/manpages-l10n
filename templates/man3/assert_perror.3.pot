"If the macro B<NDEBUG> was defined at the moment I<E<lt>assert.hE<gt>> was "
"last included, the macro B<assert_perror>()  generates no code, and hence "
"does nothing at all.  Otherwise, the macro B<assert_perror>()  prints an "
"error message to standard error and terminates the program by calling "
"B<abort>(3)  if I<errnum> is nonzero.  The message contains the filename, "
"function name and line number of the macro call, and the output of "

"The purpose of the assert macros is to help programmers find bugs in their "
"programs, things that cannot happen unless there was a coding mistake.  "
"However, with system or library calls the situation is rather different, and "
"error returns can happen, and will happen, and should be tested for.  Not by "
"an assert, where the test goes away when B<NDEBUG> is defined, but by proper "
"error handling code.  Never use this macro."
