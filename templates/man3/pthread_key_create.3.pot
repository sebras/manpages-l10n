msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"Programs often need global or static variables that have different values in "
"different threads. Since threads share one memory space, this cannot be "
"achieved with regular variables. Thread-specific data is the POSIX threads "
"answer to this need."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"Each thread possesses a private memory block, the thread-specific data area, "
"or TSD area for short. This area is indexed by TSD keys. The TSD area "
"associates values of type B<void *> to TSD keys. TSD keys are common to all "
"threads, but the value associated with a given TSD key can be different in "
"each thread."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"For concreteness, the TSD areas can be viewed as arrays of B<void *> "
"pointers, TSD keys as integer indices into these arrays, and the value of a "
"TSD key as the value of the corresponding array element in the calling "
"thread."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"When a thread is created, its TSD area initially associates B<NULL> with all "
"keys."

"B<pthread_key_create> allocates a new TSD key. The key is stored in the "
"location pointed to by I<key>. There is a limit of B<PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX> on "
"the number of keys allocated at a given time. The value initially associated "
"with the returned key is B<NULL> in all currently executing threads."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"The I<destr_function> argument, if not B<NULL>, specifies a destructor "
"function associated with the key. When a thread terminates via "
"B<pthread_exit> or by cancellation, I<destr_function> is called with "
"arguments the value associated with the key in that thread. The "
"I<destr_function> is not called if that value is B<NULL>. The order in which "
"destructor functions are called at thread termination time is unspecified."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"Before the destructor function is called, the B<NULL> value is associated "
"with the key in the current thread.  A destructor function might, however, "
"re-associate non-B<NULL> values to that key or some other key.  To deal with "
"this, if after all the destructors have been called for all non-B<NULL> "
"values, there are still some non-B<NULL> values with associated destructors, "
"then the process is repeated.  The LinuxThreads implementation stops the "
"process after B<PTHREAD_DESTRUCTOR_ITERATIONS> iterations, even if some non-"
"B<NULL> values with associated descriptors remain.  Other implementations "
"may loop indefinitely."
