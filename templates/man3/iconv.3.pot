"The B<iconv>()  function converts a sequence of characters in one character "
"encoding to a sequence of characters in another character encoding.  The "
"I<cd> argument is a conversion descriptor, previously created by a call to "
"B<iconv_open>(3); the conversion descriptor defines the character encodings "
"that B<iconv>()  uses for the conversion.  The I<inbuf> argument is the "
"address of a variable that points to the first character of the input "
"sequence; I<inbytesleft> indicates the number of bytes in that buffer.  The "
"I<outbuf> argument is the address of a variable that points to the first "
"byte available in the output buffer; I<outbytesleft> indicates the number of "
"bytes available in the output buffer."
