"What this function does is the following.  If both strings are equal, return "
"0.  Otherwise, find the position between two bytes with the property that "
"before it both strings are equal, while directly after it there is a "
"difference.  Find the largest consecutive digit strings containing (or "
"starting at, or ending at) this position.  If one or both of these is empty, "
"then return what B<strcmp>(3)  would have returned (numerical ordering of "
"byte values).  Otherwise, compare both digit strings numerically, where "
"digit strings with one or more leading zeros are interpreted as if they have "
"a decimal point in front (so that in particular digit strings with more "
"leading zeros come before digit strings with fewer leading zeros).  Thus, "
"the ordering is I<000>, I<00>, I<01>, I<010>, I<09>, I<0>, I<1>, I<9>, I<10>."

#.  FIXME: The marking is different from that in the glibc manual,
#.  which has:
#.      strverscmp: MT-Safe locale
#.  glibc manual says strverscmp should have marking locale because it calls
#.  isdigit() multiple times and isdigit() uses locale variable.
#.  But isdigit() has two implementations. With different compiling conditions,
#.  we may call isdigit() in macro, then strverscmp() should not have locale
#.  problem.
