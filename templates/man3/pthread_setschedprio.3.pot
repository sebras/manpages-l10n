#.  FIXME . nptl/pthread_setschedprio.c has the following
#.    /* If the thread should have higher priority because of some
#.       PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT mutexes it holds, adjust the priority. */
#.  Eventually (perhaps after writing the mutexattr pages), we
#.  may want to add something on the topic to this page.
#.  nptl/pthread_setschedparam.c has a similar case.
