"The game E<.Nm> is based on a fantasy game first presented in the pages of "
"E<.Em People's Computer Company> in 1973.  In Hunt the Wumpus you are placed "
"in a cave built of many different rooms, all interconnected by tunnels.  "
"Your quest is to find and shoot the evil Wumpus that resides elsewhere in "
"the cave without running into any pits or using up your limited supply of "
"arrows."

"While wandering through the cave you'll notice that, while there are tunnels "

"another portion of the cave (including those housing bottomless pits, sure "
