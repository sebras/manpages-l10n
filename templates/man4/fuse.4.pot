"This device is the primary interface between the FUSE filesystem driver and "

"At its core, FUSE is a simple client-server protocol, in which the Linux "
"kernel is the client and the daemon is the server.  After obtaining a file "
"descriptor for this device, the daemon may B<read>(2)  requests from that "
"file descriptor and is expected to B<write>(2)  back its replies.  It is "
"important to note that a file descriptor is associated with a unique FUSE "
"filesystem.  In particular, opening a second copy of this device, will not "
