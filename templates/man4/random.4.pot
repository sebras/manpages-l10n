"If a seed file is saved across reboots as recommended below (all major Linux "
"distributions have done this since 2000 at least), the output is "
"cryptographically secure against attackers without local root access as soon "
"as it is reloaded in the boot sequence, and perfectly adequate for network "
"encryption session keys.  Since reads from I</dev/random> may block, users "
"will usually want to open it in nonblocking mode (or perform a read with "
"timeout), and provide some sort of user notification if the desired entropy "
"is not immediately available."
