"The B<hd*> devices are block devices to access MFM/IDE hard disk drives in "
"raw mode.  The master drive on the primary IDE controller (major device "
"number 3) is B<hda>; the slave drive is B<hdb>.  The master drive of the "
"second controller (major device number 22)  is B<hdc> and the slave is "

"General IDE block device names have the form B<hd>I<X>, or B<hd>I<XP>, where "
"I<X> is a letter denoting the physical drive, and I<P> is a number denoting "
"the partition on that physical drive.  The first form, B<hd>I<X>, is used to "
"address the whole drive.  Partition numbers are assigned in the order the "
"partitions are discovered, and only nonempty, nonextended partitions get a "
"number.  However, partition numbers 1\\(en4 are given to the four partitions "
"described in the MBR (the \"primary\" partitions), regardless of whether "
"they are unused or extended.  Thus, the first logical partition will be "
"B<hd>I<X>B<5>\\&.  Both DOS-type partitioning and BSD-disklabel partitioning "
"are supported.  You can have at most 63 partitions on an IDE disk."
