"RTCs should not be confused with the system clock, which is a software clock "

"A key difference between an RTC and the system clock is that RTCs run even "
"when the system is in a low power state (including \"off\"), and the system "

"since system boot ... not since the POSIX Epoch.  So at boot time, and after "
"resuming from a system low power state, the system clock will often be set "
"to the current wall clock time using an RTC.  Systems without an RTC need to "
"set the system clock using another clock, maybe across the network or by "
