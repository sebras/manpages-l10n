"reads these files and attempts to add new partitions currently missing and "

"Partition files are generally matched against any partitions already "

"UUID is assigned the first definition file with the same partition type "

"partition file with the same type UUID, and so on\\&. Any left-over "
"partition files that have no matching existing partition are assumed to "

"to the end of the partition table, in the order defined by their names "
