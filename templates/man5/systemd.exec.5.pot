"The general philosophy is to expose a small curated list of environment "
"variables to processes\\&. Services started by the system manager (PID 1) "
"will be started, without additional service-specific configuration, with "
"just a few environment variables\\&. The user manager inherits environment "
"variables as any other system service, but in addition may receive "
"additional environment variables from PAM, and, typically, additional "
"imported variables when the user starts a graphical session\\&. It is "
"recommended to keep the environment blocks in both the system and user "
"managers managers lean\\&. Importing all variables inherited by the "
"graphical session or by one of the user shells is strongly discouraged\\&."
