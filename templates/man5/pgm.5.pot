"In the transparency mask variation from PGM, the value represents "
"opaqueness.  It is proportional to the fraction of intensity of a pixel that "
"would show in place of an underlying pixel.  So what normally means white "
"represents total opaqueness and what normally means black represents total "
"transparency.  In between, you would compute the intensity of a composite "
"pixel of an \"under\" and \"over\" pixel as under * (1-(alpha/alpha_maxval)) "
"+ over * (alpha/alpha_maxval).  Note that there is no gamma transfer "
"function in the transparency mask."
