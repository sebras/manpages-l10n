"The B<sane-abaton> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) "
"backend that provides access to Abaton flatbed scanners. At present, only "
"the Scan 300/GS (8bit, 256 levels of gray) is fully supported, due to the "
"absence of programming information.  The Scan 300/S (black and white)  is "
"recognized, but support for it is untested."
