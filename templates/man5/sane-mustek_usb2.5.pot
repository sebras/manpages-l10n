"The B<sane-mustek_usb2> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) "
"backend that provides access to USB flatbed scanners based on the Service & "
"Quality SQ113 chipset. At the moment, only the Mustek BearPaw 2448 TA Pro is "
"supported. It's planned to add support for other scanners that are based on "
"the SQ113 and maybe SQ11 chip. For more details, see the mustek_usb2 backend "
"homepage: I<http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb2-backend/>."
