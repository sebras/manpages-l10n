"The second, third, and fourth extended file systems, or ext2, ext3, and ext4 "
"as they are commonly known, are Linux file systems that have historically "
"been the default file system for many Linux distributions.  They are general "

"the ext2 and ext3 file systems can be mounted using the ext4 file system "
"driver, and indeed in many modern Linux distributions, the ext4 file system "
