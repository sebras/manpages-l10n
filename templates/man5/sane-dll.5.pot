"The B<sane-dll> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend "
"that provides access to an arbitrary number of other SANE backends.  These "
"backends may either be pre-loaded at the time the B<sane-dll> library is "
"built or, on systems that support dynamic loading of shared libraries, the "
"backends may be loaded at runtime.  In the latter case, adding support for a "
"new backend simply involves installing the relevant library in I</usr/lib/"
"sane> and adding an entry to the I<dll.conf> configuration file.  In other "
"words, no applications need to be modified or recompiled to add support for "
