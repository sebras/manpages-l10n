"The thinkfan config file specifies one or more temperature input(s), exactly "
"one fan to control and the fan levels.  A fan level associates a certain fan "
"speed to a lower and an upper temperature bound.  If the temperature reaches "
"the upper bound, we switch to the next fan level, and if it drops below the "
"lower bound, we switch to the previous fan level.  Temperature bounds can "
"either be a single temperature (I<simple mode>) or consist of multiple "
"temperatures (I<complex mode>).  In simple mode, only the highest of all "
"known temperature is compared to the upper & lower bound.  If you have "
"devices with very different temperature ratings (e.g. CPU vs.  mechanical "
"hard drives), you should specify correction values to equalize their "
"temperature ranges, or better: use complex mode.  In complex mode, the upper "
"and lower bounds of each fan level are specified for each sensor "
"individually.  Thinkfan then switches to the next fan level if one of the "
"upper bounds is reached, and to the previous fan level if all temperatures "
"have dropped below their respective lower bounds."
