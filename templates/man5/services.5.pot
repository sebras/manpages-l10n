"B<services> is a plain ASCII file providing a mapping between human-friendly "
"textual names for internet services, and their underlying assigned port "
"numbers and protocol types.  Every networking program should look into this "
"file to get the port number (and protocol) for its service.  The C library "
"routines B<getservent>(3), B<getservbyname>(3), B<getservbyport>(3), "
"B<setservent>(3), and B<endservent>(3)  support querying this file from "

"Port numbers below 1024 (so-called \"low numbered\" ports) can be bound to "

"port is the standard implementation, and not a rogue service run by a user "
"of the machine.  Well-known port numbers specified by the IANA are normally "
