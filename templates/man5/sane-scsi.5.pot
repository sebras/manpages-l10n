"For scanners with a SCSI interface, it may be necessary to edit the "
"appropriate backend configuration file before using SANE for the first "
"time.  For most systems, the configuration file should list the name of the "
"generic SCSI device that the scanner is connected to (e.g., under Linux, I</"
"dev/sg4> or I</dev/sge> is such a generic SCSI device).  It is customary to "
"create a symlink from I</dev/scanner> to the generic SCSI device that the "
"scanner is connected to.  In this case, the configuration file simply lists "
"the line I</dev/scanner>.  For a detailed description of each backend's "
"configuration file, please refer to the relevant backend manual page (e.g., "
"B<sane-epson>(5)  for Epson scanners, B<sane-hp>(5)  for HP scanners, etc.)."

"For scanners with a SCSI interface, it may be necessary to edit the "
"appropriate backend configuration file before using SANE for the first "
"time.  For most systems, the configuration file should list the name of the "
"generic SCSI device that the scanner is connected to (e.g., under Linux, B</"
"dev/sg4> or B</dev/sge> is such a generic SCSI device).  It is customary to "
"create a symlink from B</dev/scanner> to the generic SCSI device that the "
"scanner is connected to.  In this case, the configuration file simply lists "
"the line B</dev/scanner>.  For a detailed description of each backend's "
"configuration file, please refer to the relevant backend manual page (e.g., "
"B<sane-epson>(5)  for Epson scanners, B<sane-hp>(5)  for HP scanners, etc.)."

"To keep scanning times to a minimum, it is strongly recommended to use a "
"large buffer size for the generic SCSI driver. From SG driver version 2.0 "
"on, the maximum buffer size can be changed at program run time, and there is "
"no restriction in size. This driver version is part of the Linux kernels "
"from version 2.2.7 on. If the new SG driver is available some backends (e.g. "
"sane-umax, sane-mustek, sane-sharp) automatically request larger scsi "
"buffers. If a backend does not automatically request a larger scsi buffer, "
"set the environment variable B<SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE> to the desired buffer "
"size in bytes. It is not recommended to use more than 1 MB, because for "
"large values the probability increases that the SG driver cannot allocate "
"the necessary buffer(s). For ISA cards, even 1 MB might be a too large "
"value. For a detailed discussion of memory issues of the SG driver, see "
