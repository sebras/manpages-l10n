"A unit configuration file whose name ends in \"\\&.slice\" encodes "
"information about a slice unit\\&. A slice unit is a concept for "
"hierarchically managing resources of a group of processes\\&. This "
"management is performed by creating a node in the Linux Control Group "
"(cgroup) tree\\&. Units that manage processes (primarily scope and service "
"units) may be assigned to a specific slice\\&. For each slice, certain "
"resource limits may be set that apply to all processes of all units "
"contained in that slice\\&. Slices are organized hierarchically in a tree"
"\\&. The name of the slice encodes the location in the tree\\&. The name "
"consists of a dash-separated series of names, which describes the path to "
"the slice from the root slice\\&. The root slice is named -\\&.slice\\&. "
"Example: foo-bar\\&.slice is a slice that is located within foo\\&.slice, "
"which in turn is located in the root slice -\\&.slice\\&."
