"In SELinux, this file is used to get the security context of a process.  "
"Prior to Linux 2.6.11, this file could not be used to set the security "

"transitions to B<execve>(2)  (see the description of I</proc/[pid]/attr/"
"exec>, below).  Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux lifted this restriction and "

"policy, although use of this operation is only suitable for applications "
"that are trusted to maintain any desired separation between the old and new "
"security contexts.  Prior to Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads "
"within a multi-threaded process to set their security context via this node "
"as it would yield an inconsistency among the security contexts of the "
"threads sharing the same memory space.  Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted "
"this restriction and began supporting \"set\" operations for threads within "
"a multithreaded process if the new security context is bounded by the old "
"security context, where the bounded relation is defined in policy and "
"guarantees that the new security context has a subset of the permissions of "
"the old security context.  Other security modules may choose to support "
