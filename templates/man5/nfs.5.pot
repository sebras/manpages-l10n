"NFS is an Internet Standard protocol created by Sun Microsystems in 1984. "
"NFS was developed to allow file sharing between systems residing on a local "
"area network.  Depending on kernel configuration, the Linux NFS client may "
"support NFS versions 3, 4.0, 4.1, or 4.2."

"The Network Lock Manager protocol is a separate sideband protocol used to "
"manage file locks in NFS version 2 and version 3.  To support lock recovery "
"after a client or server reboot, a second sideband protocol -- known as the "
"Network Status Manager protocol -- is also required.  In NFS version 4, file "
"locking is supported directly in the main NFS protocol, and the NLM and NSM "
"sideband protocols are not used."

"irrevocably grants a file lock to a client.  If the lease expires, the "
