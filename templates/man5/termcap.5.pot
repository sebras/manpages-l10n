"The termcap database is an obsolete facility for describing the capabilities "

"I</etc/termcap> is an ASCII file (the database master) that lists the "
"capabilities of many different types of terminals.  Programs can read "
"termcap to find the particular escape codes needed to control the visual "
"attributes of the terminal actually in use.  (Other aspects of the terminal "
"are handled by B<stty>(1).)  The termcap database is indexed on the B<TERM> "
"environment variable."
