"A machine may crash while it is delivering a message.  For both I<mbox> "
"files and I<mh> folders this means that the message will be silently "
"truncated.  Even worse: for I<mbox> format, if the message is truncated in "
"the middle of a line, it will be silently joined to the next message.  The "
"mail transport agent will try again later to deliver the message, but it is "
"unacceptable that a corrupted message should show up at all.  In I<maildir>, "
"every message is guaranteed complete upon delivery."

"A machine may have two programs simultaneously delivering mail to the same "

"central file will be corrupted.  There are several I<mbox> and I<mh> locking "
"mechanisms, none of which work portably and reliably.  In contrast, in "
"I<maildir>, no locks are ever necessary.  Different delivery processes never "
"touch the same file."

"if two machines deliver mail to the same user, or if a user reads mail "
"anywhere except the delivery machine, the user's mail is at risk.  "
