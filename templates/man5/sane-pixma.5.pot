"The B<sane-pixma> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) "
"backend that provides access to Canon PIXMA / i-SENSYS / imageCLASS / "
"imageRUNNER multi-function devices (All-in-one printers) and the Canon "
"CanoScan Flatbed/TPU scanners.  The backend implements both the USB "
"interface and network interface (using Canon's BJNP and MFNP protocols). The "
"network interface supports scanners over IPv4 as well as IPv6 (MFNP over "
