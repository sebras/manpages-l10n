"The syntax described herein is new for version \\&CW<mtools-3.0>. The old "
"line-oriented syntax is still supported. Each line beginning with a single "
"letter is considered to be a drive description using the old syntax. Old "
"style and new style drive sections may be mixed within the same "
"configuration file, in order to make upgrading easier. Support for the old "
"syntax will be phased out eventually, and in order to discourage its use, I "
