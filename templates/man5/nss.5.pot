"Each call to a function which retrieves data from a system database like the "
"password or group database is handled by the Name Service Switch "
"implementation in the GNU C library.  The various services provided are "
"implemented by independent modules, each of which naturally varies widely "
"from the other."

"The default implementations coming with the GNU C library are by default "
"conservative and do not use unsafe data.  This might be very costly in some "
"situations, especially when the databases are large.  Some modules allow the "
"system administrator to request taking shortcuts if these are known to be "
"safe.  It is then the system administrator's responsibility to ensure the "
"assumption is correct."
