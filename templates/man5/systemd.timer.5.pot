"Takes a boolean argument\\&. If true, a timer will stay loaded, and its "
"state remains queryable even after it elapsed and the associated unit (as "
"configured with I<Unit=>, see above) deactivated again\\&. If false, an "
"elapsed timer unit that cannot elapse anymore is unloaded once its "
"associated unit deactivated again\\&. Turning this off is particularly "
"useful for transient timer units\\&. Note that this setting has an effect "
"when repeatedly starting a timer unit: if I<RemainAfterElapse=> is on, "
"starting the timer a second time has no effect\\&. However, if "
"I<RemainAfterElapse=> is off and the timer unit was already unloaded, it can "
