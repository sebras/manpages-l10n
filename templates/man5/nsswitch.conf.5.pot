"Traditionally, there was only a single source for service information, often "
"in the form of a single configuration file (e.g., I</etc/passwd>).  However, "
"as other name services, such as the Network Information Service (NIS) and "
"the Domain Name Service (DNS), became popular, a method was needed that "

"The Name Service Switch mechanism, which was based on the mechanism used by "
"Sun Microsystems in the Solaris 2 C library, introduced a cleaner solution "
