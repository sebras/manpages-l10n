"The B<sane-pnm> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend "
"that provides access to PNM (Portable aNyMap files, which covers PBM bitmap "
"files, PGM grayscale files, and PPM pixmap files).  The purpose of this "
"backend is primarily to aid in debugging of SANE frontends.  It also serves "
"as an illustrative example of a minimal SANE backend."

"If the pnm backend is installed and saned is used to allow users on remote "

"user. This is limited to the files saned can access (usually it's running as "
"user \"sane\"). All pnm files can be read if saned runs as root which isn't "
"recommended anyway. The pnm backend is disabled by default. If you want to "
"use it, enable it with configure (see configure --help for details). Be sure "
