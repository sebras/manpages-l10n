"A call to B<getaddrinfo>(3)  might return multiple answers.  According to "
"RFC\\ 3484 these answers must be sorted so that the answer with the highest "
"success rate is first in the list.  The RFC provides an algorithm for the "
"sorting.  The static rules are not always adequate, though.  For this "
"reason, the RFC also requires that system administrators should have the "
"possibility to dynamically change the sorting.  For the glibc "
"implementation, this can be achieved with the I</etc/gai.conf> file."
