"The configuration file is made up of multiple section headers followed by "
"variable assignments associated with that section.  A section header is "
"defined by a string enclosed by B<[> and B<]> brackets.  Variable "
"assignments are assignment statements that assign values to particular "
"variables using the B<=> operator, as in B<Proto=Tcp>.  The variables that "
"can be assigned are the set of NFS specific mount options listed in "
"B<nfs>(5)  together with the filesystem-independant mount options listed in "
"B<mount>(8)  and three additions: B<Sloppy=True> has the same effect as the "
"B<-s> option to I<mount>, and B<Foreground=True> and B<Background=True> have "
"the same effect as B<bg> and B<fg>."
