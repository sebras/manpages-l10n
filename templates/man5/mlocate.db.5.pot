"block> size in big endian, 1 byte for file format version (B<0>), 1 byte for "

"The header is followed by a I<configuration block>, included to ensure "
"databases are not reused if some configuration changes could affect their "
"contents.  The size of the configuration block in bytes is stored in the "
"file header.  The configuration block is a sequence of I<variable "
"assignments>, ordered by variable name.  Each I<variable assignment> "
"consists of a \\f(SMNUL\\fR-terminated variable name and an ordered list of "
"\\f(SMNUL\\fR-terminated values.  The value list is terminated by one more "
"E<.SM NUL> character.  The ordering used is defined by the B<strcmp ()> "
