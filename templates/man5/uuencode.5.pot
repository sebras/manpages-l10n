"header must not, of course, look like a header."

"The header line is distinguished by having the first 5 characters be "
"I<begin> followed by a space, or else a hyphen and either I<base64> or "
"I<encoded> or both (also separated with a hyphen).  The I<base64> option "
"says the file has been encoded using base64.  The I<encoded> option says the "
"output file I<name> has been base64 encoded.  It is never encoded with "
"traditional uuencoding.  This is a GNU extension.  These are followed by a "
"mode (in octal), and a string which names the remote file.  The mode is "
"separated from the I<begin> clause and the file name by a single space "

"The traditional I<uuencoded> file body consists of a number of lines, each "
"at most 62 characters long (including the trailing newline). These consist "
"of a character count letter, followed by the encoded characters, followed by "
"a newline.  The character count is a single printing character, and "
"represents an integer, the number of bytes the rest of the line represents.  "
"Such integers are always in the range from 0 to 63 and can be determined by "
"subtracting the character space (octal 40)  from the character."

"garbage will be included to make the character count a multiple of 4.  The "
