"Note that, unlike service units, scope units have no \"main\" process: all "
"processes in the scope are equivalent\\&. The lifecycle of the scope unit is "
"thus not bound to the lifetime of one specific process, but to the existence "
"of at least one process in the scope\\&. This also means that the exit "
"statuses of these processes are not relevant for the scope unit failure "
"state\\&. Scope units may still enter a failure state, for example due to "
"resource exhaustion or stop timeouts being reached, but not due to programs "
"inside of them terminating uncleanly\\&. Since processes managed as scope "
"units generally remain children of the original process that forked them "
"off, it is also the job of that process to collect their exit statuses and "
"act on them as needed\\&."
