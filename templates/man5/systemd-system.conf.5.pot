"B<bootup>(7)  for details\\&. During the first phase of the shutdown "
"operation the system and service manager remains running and hence "
"I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> is still honoured\\&. In order to define a timeout on "
"this first phase of system shutdown, configure I<JobTimeoutSec=> and "
"I<JobTimeoutAction=> in the [Unit] section of the shutdown\\&.target unit"
"\\&. By default I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> defaults to 0 (off), and "
"I<RebootWatchdogSec=> to 10min\\&.  I<KExecWatchdogSec=> may be used to "
"additionally enable the watchdog when kexec is being executed rather than "
"when rebooting\\&. Note that if the kernel does not reset the watchdog on "
"kexec (depending on the specific hardware and/or driver), in this case the "
"watchdog might not get disabled after kexec succeeds and thus the system "
"might get rebooted, unless I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> is also enabled at the "
"same time\\&. For this reason it is recommended to enable "
"I<KExecWatchdogSec=> only if I<RuntimeWatchdogSec=> is also enabled\\&. "
"These settings have no effect if a hardware watchdog is not available\\&."
