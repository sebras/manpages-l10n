"The B<sane-test> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend "
"that allows testing the SANE installation and SANE frontends.  It provides "
"access to a (nearly) unlimited number of virtual devices.  There is no "
"support for real scanners or cameras.  However, the backend simulates "
"scanning and setting options."
