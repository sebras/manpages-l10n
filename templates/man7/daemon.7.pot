"Other forms of activation have been suggested and implemented in some "
"systems\\&. However, there are often simpler or better alternatives, or they "
"can be put together of combinations of the schemes above\\&. Example: "
"Sometimes, it appears useful to start daemons or \\&.socket units when a "
"specific IP address is configured on a network interface, because network "
"sockets shall be bound to the address\\&. However, an alternative to "
"implement this is by utilizing the Linux B<IP_FREEBIND>/B<IPV6_FREEBIND> "
"socket option, as accessible via I<FreeBind=yes> in systemd socket files "
"(see B<systemd.socket>(5)  for details)\\&. This option, when enabled, "
"allows sockets to be bound to a non-local, not configured IP address, and "
"hence allows bindings to a particular IP address before it actually becomes "
"available, making such an explicit dependency to the configured address "
"redundant\\&. Another often suggested trigger for service activation is low "
"system load\\&. However, here too, a more convincing approach might be to "
"make proper use of features of the operating system, in particular, the CPU "
"or I/O scheduler of Linux\\&. Instead of scheduling jobs from userspace "
"based on monitoring the OS scheduler, it is advisable to leave the "
"scheduling of processes to the OS scheduler itself\\&. systemd provides fine-"
"grained access to the CPU and I/O schedulers\\&. If a process executed by "
"the init system shall not negatively impact the amount of CPU or I/O "
"bandwidth available to other processes, it should be configured with "
"I<CPUSchedulingPolicy=idle> and/or I<IOSchedulingClass=idle>\\&. Optionally, "
"this may be combined with timer-based activation to schedule background jobs "
"during runtime and with minimal impact on the system, and remove it from the "
"boot phase itself\\&."
