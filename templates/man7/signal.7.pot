#.  Joseph C. Sible notes:
#.  On Linux, if the main thread has the signal unblocked, then the kernel
#.  will always deliver the signal there, citing this kernel code
#.      Per this comment in kernel/signal.c since time immemorial:
#.      /*
#.      * Now find a thread we can wake up to take the signal off the queue.
#.      *
#.      * If the main thread wants the signal, it gets first crack.
#.      * Probably the least surprising to the average bear.
#.      */
#.  But this does not mean the signal will be delivered only in the
#.  main thread, since if a handler is already executing in the main thread
#.  (and thus the signal is blocked in that thread), then a further
#.  might be delivered in a different thread.
