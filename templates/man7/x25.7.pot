"X25 sockets provide an interface to the X.25 packet layer protocol.  This "
"allows applications to communicate over a public X.25 data network as "
"standardized by International Telecommunication Union's recommendation X.25 "
"(X.25 DTE-DCE mode).  X25 sockets can also be used for communication without "
"an intermediate X.25 network (X.25 DTE-DTE mode) as described in ISO-8208."

"Message boundaries are preserved \\(em a B<read>(2)  from a socket will "

"B<write>(2)  to the peer socket.  When necessary, the kernel takes care of "
"segmenting and reassembling long messages by means of the X.25 M-bit.  There "
"is no hard-coded upper limit for the message size.  However, reassembling of "
"a long message might fail if there is a temporary lack of system resources "
"or when other constraints (such as socket memory or buffer size limits) "
"become effective.  If that occurs, the X.25 connection will be reset."
