"Control groups, usually referred to as cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature "
"which allow processes to be organized into hierarchical groups whose usage "
"of various types of resources can then be limited and monitored.  The "
"kernel's cgroup interface is provided through a pseudo-filesystem called "
"cgroupfs.  Grouping is implemented in the core cgroup kernel code, while "
"resource tracking and limits are implemented in a set of per-resource-type "
"subsystems (memory, CPU, and so on)."
