"B<Linux-PAM> is a system of libraries that handle the authentication tasks "
"of applications (services) on the system\\&. The library provides a stable "
"general interface (Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege "
"granting programs (such as B<login>(1)  and B<su>(1)) defer to to perform "
"standard authentication tasks\\&."

"The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the "
"authentication is dynamically configurable\\&. In other words, the system "
"administrator is free to choose how individual service-providing "
"applications will authenticate users\\&. This dynamic configuration is set "
"by the contents of the single B<Linux-PAM> configuration file /etc/pam\\&."
"conf\\&. Alternatively, the configuration can be set by individual "
"configuration files located in the /etc/pam\\&.d/ directory\\&. The presence "
"of this directory will cause B<Linux-PAM> to I<ignore> /etc/pam\\&.conf\\&."

"Vendor-supplied PAM configuration files might be installed in the system "
"directory /usr/lib/pam\\&.d/ or a configurable vendor specific directory "
"instead of the machine configuration directory /etc/pam\\&.d/\\&. If no "
"machine configuration file is found, the vendor-supplied file is used\\&. "
"All files in /etc/pam\\&.d/ override files with the same name in other "
"directories\\&."

"From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is "
"provided, it is not of primary importance to understand the internal "
"behavior of the B<Linux-PAM> library\\&. The important point to recognize is "
"that the configuration file(s)  I<define> the connection between "
"applications (B<services>) and the pluggable authentication modules "
"(B<PAM>s) that perform the actual authentication tasks\\&."

"B<Linux-PAM> separates the tasks of I<authentication> into four independent "
"management groups: B<account> management; B<auth>entication management; "
"B<password> management; and B<session> management\\&. (We highlight the "
"abbreviations used for these groups in the configuration file\\&.)"

"B<auth>entication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials\\&. "
"Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the user must "
"satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your password\\&. Not "
"all authentications are of this type, there exist hardware based "
"authentication schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric "
"devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for "
"more standard approaches to authentication - such is the flexibility of "
"B<Linux-PAM>\\&."

"B<password> - this group\\*(Aqs responsibility is the task of updating "
