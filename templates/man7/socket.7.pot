"Linux will allow port reuse only with the B<SO_REUSEADDR> option when this "
"option was set both in the previous program that performed a B<bind>(2)  to "
"the port and in the program that wants to reuse the port.  This differs from "
"some implementations (e.g., FreeBSD)  where only the later program needs to "
"set the B<SO_REUSEADDR> option.  Typically this difference is invisible, "
"since, for example, a server program is designed to always set this option."
