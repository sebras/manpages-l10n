"IPC namespaces isolate certain IPC resources, namely, System V IPC objects "
"(see B<sysvipc>(7))  and (since Linux 2.6.30)  POSIX message queues (see "
"B<mq_overview>(7)).  The common characteristic of these IPC mechanisms is "
"that IPC objects are identified by mechanisms other than filesystem "
"pathnames."
