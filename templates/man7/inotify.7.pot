"When a watch descriptor is removed by calling B<inotify_rm_watch>(2)  (or "
"because a watch file is deleted or the filesystem that contains it is "
"unmounted), any pending unread events for that watch descriptor remain "
"available to read.  As watch descriptors are subsequently allocated with "
"B<inotify_add_watch>(2), the kernel cycles through the range of possible "
"watch descriptors (0 to B<INT_MAX>)  incrementally.  When allocating a free "
"watch descriptor, no check is made to see whether that watch descriptor "
"number has any pending unread events in the inotify queue.  Thus, it can "
"happen that a watch descriptor is reallocated even when pending unread "
"events exist for a previous incarnation of that watch descriptor number, "
"with the result that the application might then read those events and "
"interpret them as belonging to the file associated with the newly recycled "
"watch descriptor.  In practice, the likelihood of hitting this bug may be "
"extremely low, since it requires that an application cycle through "
"B<INT_MAX> watch descriptors, release a watch descriptor while leaving "
"unread events for that watch descriptor in the queue, and then recycle that "
"watch descriptor.  For this reason, and because there have been no reports "
"of the bug occurring in real-world applications, as of Linux 3.15, no kernel "
"changes have yet been made to eliminate this possible bug."
