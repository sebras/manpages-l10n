"If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as if all case "
"distinctions had vanished from the alphabet.  When an alphabetic that exists "
"in multiple cases appears as an ordinary character outside a bracket "
"expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression "
"containing both cases, for example, \\(aqx\\(aq becomes \"I<[xX]>\".  When "
"it appears inside a bracket expression, all case counterparts of it are "
"added to the bracket expression, so that, for example, \"I<[x]>\" becomes "
"\"I<[xX]>\" and \"I<[^x]>\" becomes \"I<[^xX]>\"."

"Obsolete (\"basic\") regular expressions differ in several respects.  \\(aq|"
"\\(aq, \\(aq+\\(aq, and \\(aq?\\(aq are ordinary characters and there is no "
"equivalent for their functionality.  The delimiters for bounds are "
"\"I<\\e{>\" and \"I<\\e}>\", with \\(aq{\\(aq and \\(aq}\\(aq by themselves "
"ordinary characters.  The parentheses for nested subexpressions are "
"\"I<\\e(>\" and \"I<\\e)>\", with \\(aq(\\(aq and \\(aq)\\(aq by themselves "

"\\(aq$\\(aq is an ordinary character except at the end of the RE or\\*(dg "
