"POSIX.1 says that B<write>(2)s of less than B<PIPE_BUF> bytes must be "
"atomic: the output data is written to the pipe as a contiguous sequence.  "
"Writes of more than B<PIPE_BUF> bytes may be nonatomic: the kernel may "
"interleave the data with data written by other processes.  POSIX.1 requires "
"B<PIPE_BUF> to be at least 512 bytes.  (On Linux, B<PIPE_BUF> is 4096 "
"bytes.)  The precise semantics depend on whether the file descriptor is "
"nonblocking (B<O_NONBLOCK>), whether there are multiple writers to the pipe, "
"and on I<n>, the number of bytes to be written:"
