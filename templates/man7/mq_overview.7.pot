"System V message queues (B<msgget>(2), B<msgsnd>(2), B<msgrcv>(2), etc.) are "
"an older API for exchanging messages between processes.  POSIX message "
"queues provide a better designed interface than System V message queues; on "
"the other hand POSIX message queues are less widely available (especially on "

"As originally implemented (and documented), the QSIZE field displayed the "
"total number of (user-supplied)  bytes in all messages in the message "
"queue.  Some changes in Linux 3.5 inadvertently changed the behavior, so "
"that this field also included a count of kernel overhead bytes used to store "
"the messages in the queue.  This behavioral regression was rectified in "
"Linux 4.2 (and earlier stable kernel series), so that the count once more "
"included just the bytes of user data in messages in the queue."
