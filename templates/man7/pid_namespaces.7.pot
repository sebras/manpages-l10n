"If the \"init\" process of a PID namespace terminates, the kernel terminates "
"all of the processes in the namespace via a B<SIGKILL> signal.  This "
"behavior reflects the fact that the \"init\" process is essential for the "
"correct operation of a PID namespace.  In this case, a subsequent "
"B<fork>(2)  into this PID namespace fail with the error B<ENOMEM>; it is not "
"possible to create a new processes in a PID namespace whose \"init\" process "
"has terminated.  Such scenarios can occur when, for example, a process uses "
"an open file descriptor for a I</proc/[pid]/ns/pid> file corresponding to a "
"process that was in a namespace to B<setns>(2)  into that namespace after "
"the \"init\" process has terminated.  Another possible scenario can occur "
"after a call to B<unshare>(2): if the first child subsequently created by a "
"B<fork>(2)  terminates, then subsequent calls to B<fork>(2)  fail with "
"B<ENOMEM>."
