"The Linux kernel provides futexes (\"Fast user-space mutexes\")  as a "
"building block for fast user-space locking and semaphores.  Futexes are very "
"basic and lend themselves well for building higher-level locking "
"abstractions such as mutexes, condition variables, read-write locks, "
"barriers, and semaphores."

"A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be shared between "
"processes or threads.  In these different processes, the futex need not have "
"identical addresses.  In its bare form, a futex has semaphore semantics; it "
"is a counter that can be incremented and decremented atomically; processes "
"can wait for the value to become positive."

"Futex operation occurs entirely in user space for the noncontended case.  "
"The kernel is involved only to arbitrate the contended case.  As any sane "
"design will strive for noncontention, futexes are also optimized for this "

"In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is touched only by "
"atomic assembler instructions.  This integer is four bytes long on all "
"platforms.  Processes can share this integer using B<mmap>(2), via shared "
"memory segments, or because they share memory space, in which case the "
"application is commonly called multithreaded."
