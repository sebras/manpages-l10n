"A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original file because it "
"is a reference to the object underlying the original filename.  (To be "
"precise: each of the hard links to a file is a reference to the same I<inode "
"number>, where an inode number is an index into the inode table, which "
"contains metadata about all files on a filesystem.  See B<stat>(2).)  "
"Changes to a file are independent of the name used to reference the file.  "
"Hard links may not refer to directories (to prevent the possibility of loops "
"within the filesystem tree, which would confuse many programs)  and may not "
"refer to files on different filesystems (because inode numbers are not "
"unique across filesystems)."

"words, a symbolic link is a pointer to another name, and not to an "
