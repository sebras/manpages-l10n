"The fanotify API provides notification and interception of filesystem "
"events.  Use cases include virus scanning and hierarchical storage "
"management.  In the original fanotify API, only a limited set of events was "
"supported.  In particular, there was no support for create, delete, and move "
"events.  The support for those events was added in Linux 5.1.  (See "
"B<inotify>(7)  for details of an API that did notify those events pre Linux "
"5.1.)"
