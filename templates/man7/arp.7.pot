"The ARP module maintains a cache of mappings between hardware addresses and "

"using the B<MSG_CONFIRM> flag to B<sendmsg>(2).  When there is no forward "
"progress, ARP tries to reprobe.  It first tries to ask a local arp daemon "
"B<app_solicit> times for an updated MAC address.  If that fails and an old "
"MAC address is known, a unicast probe is sent B<ucast_solicit> times.  If "
"that fails too, it will broadcast a new ARP request to the network.  "

"There is no way to signal positive feedback from user space.  This means "
"connection-oriented protocols implemented in user space will generate "
"excessive ARP traffic, because ndisc will regularly reprobe the MAC "
"address.  The same problem applies for some kernel protocols (e.g., NFS over "
"UDP)."
