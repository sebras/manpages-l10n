"This kernel protocol module implements the Address Resolution Protocol "
"defined in RFC\\ 826.  It is used to convert between Layer2 hardware "
"addresses and IPv4 protocol addresses on directly connected networks.  The "
"user normally doesn't interact directly with this module except to configure "
"it; instead it provides a service for other protocols in the kernel."

"The ARP module maintains a cache of mappings between hardware addresses and "
"protocol addresses.  The cache has a limited size so old and less frequently "
"used entries are garbage-collected.  Entries which are marked as permanent "
"are never deleted by the garbage-collector.  The cache can be directly "
"manipulated by the use of ioctls and its behavior can be tuned by the I</"

"When there is no positive feedback for an existing mapping after some time "
"(see the I</proc> interfaces below), a neighbor cache entry is considered "
"stale.  Positive feedback can be gotten from a higher layer; for example "
"from a successful TCP ACK.  Other protocols can signal forward progress "
"using the B<MSG_CONFIRM> flag to B<sendmsg>(2).  When there is no forward "
"progress, ARP tries to reprobe.  It first tries to ask a local arp daemon "
"B<app_solicit> times for an updated MAC address.  If that fails and an old "
"MAC address is known, a unicast probe is sent B<ucast_solicit> times.  If "
"that fails too, it will broadcast a new ARP request to the network.  "
"Requests are sent only when there is data queued for sending."
