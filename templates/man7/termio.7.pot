"B<termio> is the name of the old System V terminal driver interface.  This "
"interface defined a I<termio> structure used to store terminal settings, and "
"a range of B<ioctl>(2)  operations to get and set terminal attributes."

"The B<termio> interface is now obsolete: POSIX.1-1990 standardized a "
"modified version of this interface, under the name B<termios>.  The POSIX.1 "
"data structure differs slightly from the System V version, and POSIX.1 "
"defined a suite of functions to replace the various B<ioctl>(2)  operations "
"that existed in System V.  (This was done because B<ioctl>(2)  was "
"unstandardized, and its variadic third argument does not allow argument type "
"checking.)"
