"Unicode (ISO 10646) is a standard which aims to unambiguously represent "
"every character in every human language.  Unicode's structure permits 20.1 "
"bits to encode every character.  Since most computers don't include 20.1-bit "
"integers, Unicode is usually encoded as 32-bit integers internally and "
"either a series of 16-bit integers (UTF-16) (needing two 16-bit integers "
"only when encoding certain rare characters) or a series of 8-bit bytes "
"(UTF-8)."

"For most texts in ISO 8859 character sets, this means that the characters "
"outside of ASCII are now coded with two bytes.  This tends to expand "
"ordinary text files by only one or two percent.  For Russian or Greek texts, "
"this expands ordinary text files by 100%, since text in those languages is "
"mostly outside of ASCII.  For Japanese users this means that the 16-bit "

"conversions from some character sets (especially ISO 8859-1) to Unicode, "
"general conversion requires carrying around conversion tables, which can be "
"quite large for 16-bit codes."

"Rendering of Unicode data streams is typically handled through \"subfont\" "
