"The term \"libc\" is commonly used as a shorthand for the \"standard C "
"library\", a library of standard functions that can be used by all C "
"programs (and sometimes by programs in other languages).  Because of some "
"history (see below), use of the term \"libc\" to refer to the standard C "
"library is somewhat ambiguous on Linux."

"By far the most widely used C library on Linux is the GNU C Library E<.UR "
"http://www.gnu.org\\:/software\\:/libc/> E<.UE ,> often referred to as "
"I<glibc>.  This is the C library that is nowadays used in all major Linux "
"distributions.  It is also the C library whose details are documented in the "
"relevant pages of the I<man-pages> project (primarily in Section 3 of the "
"manual).  Documentation of glibc is also available in the glibc manual, "
"available via the command I<info libc>.  Release 1.0 of glibc was made in "
"September 1992.  (There were earlier 0.x releases.)  The next major release "
"of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of 1997."

"In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while I<Linux libc>, a fork of "
"glibc 1.x created by Linux developers who felt that glibc development at the "
"time was not sufficing for the needs of Linux.  Often, this library was "
"referred to (ambiguously) as just \"libc\".  Linux libc released major "
"versions 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as many minor versions of those releases.  "
"Linux libc4 was the last version to use the a.out binary format, and the "
"first version to provide (primitive) shared library support.  Linux libc 5 "
"was the first version to support the ELF binary format; this version used "
"the shared library soname I<libc.so.5>.  For a while, Linux libc was the "
"standard C library in many Linux distributions."

"However, notwithstanding the original motivations of the Linux libc effort, "
"by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in 1997), it was clearly superior to "
"Linux libc, and all major Linux distributions that had been using Linux libc "
"soon switched back to glibc.  To avoid any confusion with Linux libc "
"versions, glibc 2.0 and later used the shared library soname I<libc.so.6>."
