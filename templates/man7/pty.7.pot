"A pseudoterminal (sometimes abbreviated \"pty\")  is a pair of virtual "
"character devices that provide a bidirectional communication channel.  One "
"end of the channel is called the I<master>; the other end is called the "
"I<slave>."

"The slave end of the pseudoterminal provides an interface that behaves "
"exactly like a classical terminal.  A process that expects to be connected "
"to a terminal, can open the slave end of a pseudoterminal and then be driven "
"by a program that has opened the master end.  Anything that is written on "
"the master end is provided to the process on the slave end as though it was "
"input typed on a terminal.  For example, writing the interrupt character "
"(usually control-C)  to the master device would cause an interrupt signal "
"(B<SIGINT>)  to be generated for the foreground process group that is "
"connected to the slave.  Conversely, anything that is written to the slave "
"end of the pseudoterminal can be read by the process that is connected to "
"the master end."

"Data flow between master and slave is handled asynchronously, much like data "
"flow with a physical terminal.  Data written to the slave will be available "
"at the master promptly, but may not be available immediately.  Similarly, "
"there may be a small processing delay between a write to the master, and the "
"effect being visible at the slave."
