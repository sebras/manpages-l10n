"The B<restart_syscall>()  system call is used to restart certain system "
"calls after a process that was stopped by a signal (e.g., B<SIGSTOP> or "
"B<SIGTSTP>)  is later resumed after receiving a B<SIGCONT> signal.  This "
"system call is designed only for internal use by the kernel."
msgstr ""

#.  These system calls correspond to the special internal errno value
#.  ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK. Each of the system calls has a "restart"
#.  helper function that is invoked by restart_syscall().
#.  Notable (as at Linux 3.17) is that poll() has such a "restart"
#.  function, but ppoll(), select(), and pselect() do not.
#.  This means that the latter system calls do not take account of the
#.  time spent in the stopped state when restarting.
