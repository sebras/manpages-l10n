"symbolic link.  However, since kernel 2.0, Linux does not do so: if "
"I<oldpath> is a symbolic link, then I<newpath> is created as a (hard) link "
"to the same symbolic link file (i.e., I<newpath> becomes a symbolic link to "
"the same file that I<oldpath> refers to).  Some other implementations behave "
"in the same manner as Linux.  POSIX.1-2008 changes the specification of "
"B<link>(), making it implementation-dependent whether or not I<oldpath> is "
"dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.  For precise control over the "
"treatment of symbolic links when creating a link, use B<linkat>()."
