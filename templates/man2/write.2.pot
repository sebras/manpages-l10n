"A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.  This error may "
"relate to the write-back of data written by an earlier B<write>(2), which "
"may have been issued to a different file descriptor on the same file.  Since "
"Linux 4.13, errors from write-back come with a promise that they I<may> be "
"reported by subsequent.  B<write>(2)  requests, and I<will> be reported by a "
"subsequent B<fsync>(2)  (whether or not they were also reported by "
"B<write>(2)).  An alternate cause of B<EIO> on networked filesystems is when "
"an advisory lock had been taken out on the file descriptor and this lock has "
"been lost.  See the I<Lost locks> section of B<fcntl>(2)  for further "
"details."

"A successful return from B<write>()  does not make any guarantee that data "
"has been committed to disk.  On some filesystems, including NFS, it does not "
"even guarantee that space has successfully been reserved for the data.  In "
"this case, some errors might be delayed until a future B<write>(2), "
"B<fsync>(2), or even B<close>(2).  The only way to be sure is to call "
"B<fsync>(2)  after you are done writing all your data."
