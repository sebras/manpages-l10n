#.  The preferred way to invoke system calls that glibc does not know

#.  .BR syscall (2).
#.  However, this mechanism can be used only if using a libc
#.  (such as glibc) that supports
#.  .BR syscall (2),
#.  and if the
#.  .I <sys/syscall.h>
#.  header file contains the required SYS_foo definition.
