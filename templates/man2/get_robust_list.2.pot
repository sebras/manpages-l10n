"These system calls deal with per-thread robust futex lists.  These lists are "
"managed in user space: the kernel knows only about the location of the head "
"of the list.  A thread can inform the kernel of the location of its robust "
"futex list using B<set_robust_list>().  The address of a thread's robust "
"futex list can be obtained using B<get_robust_list>()."

"The purpose of the robust futex list is to ensure that if a thread "
"accidentally fails to unlock a futex before terminating or calling "
"B<execve>(2), another thread that is waiting on that futex is notified that "
"the former owner of the futex has died.  This notification consists of two "
"pieces: the B<FUTEX_OWNER_DIED> bit is set in the futex word, and the kernel "
"performs a B<futex>(2)  B<FUTEX_WAKE> operation on one of the threads "
"waiting on the futex."
