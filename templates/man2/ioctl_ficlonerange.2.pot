"If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between multiple "
"files (\"reflink\"), this B<ioctl>(2)  operation can be used to make some of "
"the data in the I<src_fd> file appear in the I<dest_fd> file by sharing the "
"underlying storage, which is faster than making a separate physical copy of "
"the data.  Both files must reside within the same filesystem.  If a file "
"write should occur to a shared region, the filesystem must ensure that the "
"changes remain private to the file being written.  This behavior is commonly "
"referred to as \"copy on write\"."
