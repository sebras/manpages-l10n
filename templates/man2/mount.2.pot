"Starting with kernel 2.4.19, Linux provides per-process mount namespaces.  A "
"mount namespace is the set of filesystem mounts that are visible to a "
"process.  Mount-point namespaces can be (and usually are)  shared between "
"multiple processes, and changes to the namespace (i.e., mounts and unmounts) "
"by one process are visible to all other processes sharing the same "
"namespace.  (The pre-2.4.19 Linux situation can be considered as one in "
"which a single namespace was shared by every process on the system.)"
