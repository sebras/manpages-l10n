#.  mtk: Are there circumstances where the user sessions and UID-specific
#.  keyrings do not exist?
#.  David Howells:
#.      The uid keyrings don't exist until someone tries to access them -
#.      at which point they're both created.  When you log in, pam_keyinit
#.      creates a link to your user keyring in the session keyring it just
#.      created, thereby creating the user and user-session keyrings.
#.  and David elaborated that "access" means:
#.      It means lookup_user_key() was passed KEY_LOOKUP_CREATE.  So:
#.          add_key() - destination keyring
#.          request_key() - destination keyring
#.          KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID - if create arg is true
#.          KEYCTL_CLEAR
#.          KEYCTL_LINK - both args
#.          KEYCTL_SEARCH - destination keyring
#.          KEYCTL_CHOWN
#.          KEYCTL_SETPERM
#.          KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT
#.          KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE - destination keyring
#.          KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV - destination keyring
#.          KEYCTL_NEGATE - destination keyring
#.          KEYCTL_REJECT - destination keyring
#.          KEYCTL_GET_PERSISTENT - destination keyring
#.      will all create a keyring under some circumstances.  Whereas the rest,
#.      such as KEYCTL_GET_SECURITY, KEYCTL_READ and KEYCTL_REVOKE, won't.
