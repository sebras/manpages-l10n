#.  David Herrmann:
#.      memfd uses VM_NORESERVE so each page is accounted on first access.

#.      memory-cgroup limits (mem_cgroup_try_charge()) are applied. Note that
#.      those are accounted on "current" and "current->mm", that is, the
#.      process doing the first page access.

"B<memfd_create>()  creates an anonymous file and returns a file descriptor "
