"POSIX.1 defines I<seconds since the Epoch> using a formula that approximates "
"the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch.  This formula "
"takes account of the facts that all years that are evenly divisible by 4 are "
"leap years, but years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years "
"unless they are also evenly divisible by 400, in which case they are leap "
"years.  This value is not the same as the actual number of seconds between "
"the time and the Epoch, because of leap seconds and because system clocks "
"are not required to be synchronized to a standard reference.  The intention "
"is that the interpretation of seconds since the Epoch values be consistent; "
"see POSIX.1-2008 Rationale A.4.15 for further rationale."
