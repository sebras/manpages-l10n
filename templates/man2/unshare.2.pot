#.  FIXME all of the following needs to be reviewed for the current kernel
#.  However, we can do unshare(CLONE_SIGHAND) if CLONE_SIGHAND
#.  was not specified when doing clone(); i.e., unsharing
#.  signal handlers is permitted if we are not actually
#.  sharing signal handlers.   mtk
#.  However, we can do unshare(CLONE_VM) if CLONE_VM
#.  was not specified when doing clone(); i.e., unsharing
#.  virtual memory is permitted if we are not actually
#.  sharing virtual memory.   mtk
#. 9) Future Work
#. --------------
#. The current implementation of unshare does not allow unsharing of
#. signals and signal handlers. Signals are complex to begin with and
#. to unshare signals and/or signal handlers of a currently running
#. process is even more complex. If in the future there is a specific
#. need to allow unsharing of signals and/or signal handlers, it can
#. be incrementally added to unshare without affecting legacy
#. applications using unshare.
