"Because the Linux kernel's B<faccessat>()  system call does not support a "
"I<flags> argument, the glibc B<faccessat>()  wrapper function provided in "
"glibc 2.32 and earlier emulates the required functionality using a "
"combination of the B<faccessat>()  system call and B<fstatat>(2).  However, "
"this emulation does not take ACLs into account.  Starting with glibc 2.33, "
"the wrapper function avoids this bug by making use of the B<faccessat2>()  "
"system call where it is provided by the underlying kernel."
