"The B<chown>()  semantics are deliberately violated on NFS filesystems which "
"have UID mapping enabled.  Additionally, the semantics of all system calls "
"which access the file contents are violated, because B<chown>()  may cause "
"immediate access revocation on already open files.  Client side caching may "
"lead to a delay between the time where ownership have been changed to allow "
"access for a user and the time where the file can actually be accessed by "
"the user on other clients."
