"On Linux, a process has both a filesystem user ID and an effective user ID.  "
"The (Linux-specific) filesystem user ID is used for permissions checking "
"when accessing filesystem objects, while the effective user ID is used for "
"various other kinds of permissions checks (see B<credentials>(7))."

"Normally, the value of the process's filesystem user ID is the same as the "
"value of its effective user ID.  This is so, because whenever a process's "
"effective user ID is changed, the kernel also changes the filesystem user ID "
"to be the same as the new value of the effective user ID.  A process can "
"cause the value of its filesystem user ID to diverge from its effective user "
"ID by using B<setfsuid>()  to change its filesystem user ID to the value "
"given in I<fsuid>."

"Explicit calls to B<setfsuid>()  and B<setfsgid>(2)  are (were) usually used "

"real and effective user and group IDs.  A change in the normal user IDs for "
"a program such as the NFS server is (was) a security hole that can expose it "

"At the time when this system call was introduced, one process could send a "

"if a privileged process changed its effective user ID for the purpose of "
"file permission checking, then it could become vulnerable to receiving "
"signals sent by another (unprivileged) process with the same user ID.  The "
"filesystem user ID attribute was thus added to allow a process to change its "

"time becoming vulnerable to receiving unwanted signals.  Since Linux 2.0, "
"signal permission handling is different (see B<kill>(2)), with the result "
"that a process can change its effective user ID without being vulnerable to "
"receiving signals from unwanted processes.  Thus, B<setfsuid>()  is nowadays "
"unneeded and should be avoided in new applications (likewise for "
"B<setfsgid>(2))."
