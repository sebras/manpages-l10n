"The original Linux system call was named B<sigsuspend>().  However, with the "
"addition of real-time signals in Linux 2.2, the fixed-size, 32-bit "
"I<sigset_t> type supported by that system call was no longer fit for "
"purpose.  Consequently, a new system call, B<rt_sigsuspend>(), was added to "
"support an enlarged I<sigset_t> type.  The new system call takes a second "
"argument, I<size_t sigsetsize>, which specifies the size in bytes of the "
"signal set in I<mask>.  This argument is currently required to have the "
"value I<sizeof(sigset_t)> (or the error B<EINVAL> results).  The glibc "
"B<sigsuspend>()  wrapper function hides these details from us, transparently "
"calling B<rt_sigsuspend>()  when the kernel provides it."
