"This system call is extremely dangerous and should not be used in portable "

"I<btrfs>)  an overwrite of existing allocated blocks is impossible.  When "
"writing into preallocated space, many filesystems also require calls into "
"the block allocator, which this system call does not sync out to disk.  This "
