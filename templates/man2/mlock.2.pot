"In Linux 4.8 and earlier, a bug in the kernel's accounting of locked memory "
"for unprivileged processes (i.e., without B<CAP_IPC_LOCK>)  meant that if "
"the region specified by I<addr> and I<len> overlapped an existing lock, then "
"the already locked bytes in the overlapping region were counted twice when "
