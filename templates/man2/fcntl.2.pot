#.      indefinitely ("why can't I read my mail"... I remember it well).
#.  Jeff Layton:

#.      periodically to clean out expired stateful objects, and it's likely
#.      that there is some time (maybe even up to another whole lease period)
#.      between when the timeout expires and the job actually runs. If the
