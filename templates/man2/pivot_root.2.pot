#.  Reconfirmed that the following error occurs on Linux 5.0 by
#.  specifying 'new_root' as "/rootfs" and 'put_old' as
#.  "/rootfs/oldrootfs", and *not* bind mounting "/rootfs" on top of
#.  itself. Of course, this is an odd situation, since a later check
#.  in the kernel code will in any case yield EINVAL if 'new_root' is
#.  not a mount point. However, when the system call was first added,
#.  'new_root' was not required to be a mount point. So, this
#.  error is nowadays probably just the result of crufty accumulation.
#.  This error can also occur if we bind mount "/" on top of itself
#.  and try to specify "/" as the 'new' (again, an odd situation). So,
#.  the EBUSY check in the kernel does still seem necessary to prevent
#.  that case.  Furthermore, the "or put_old" piece is probably
#.  redundant text (although the check is in the kernel), since,
#.  in another check, 'put_old' is required to be under 'new_root'.
