"On Linux, a process has both a filesystem group ID and an effective group "
"ID.  The (Linux-specific) filesystem group ID is used for permissions "
"checking when accessing filesystem objects, while the effective group ID is "
"used for some other kinds of permissions checks (see B<credentials>(7))."

"Normally, the value of the process's filesystem group ID is the same as the "
"value of its effective group ID.  This is so, because whenever a process's "
"effective group ID is changed, the kernel also changes the filesystem group "
"ID to be the same as the new value of the effective group ID.  A process can "
"cause the value of its filesystem group ID to diverge from its effective "
"group ID by using B<setfsgid>()  to change its filesystem group ID to the "
"value given in I<fsgid>."
