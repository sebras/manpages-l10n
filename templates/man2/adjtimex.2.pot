"Linux uses David L. Mills' clock adjustment algorithm (see RFC\\ 5905).  The "
"system call B<adjtimex>()  reads and optionally sets adjustment parameters "
"for this algorithm.  It takes a pointer to a I<timex> structure, updates "
"kernel parameters from (selected) field values, and returns the same "
