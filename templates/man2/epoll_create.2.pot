"In the initial B<epoll_create>()  implementation, the I<size> argument "
"informed the kernel of the number of file descriptors that the caller "
"expected to add to the B<epoll> instance.  The kernel used this information "
"as a hint for the amount of space to initially allocate in internal data "
"structures describing events.  (If necessary, the kernel would allocate more "
"space if the caller's usage exceeded the hint given in I<size>.)  Nowadays, "
"this hint is no longer required (the kernel dynamically sizes the required "
