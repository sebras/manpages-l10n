"The behavior of B<O_DIRECT> with NFS will differ from local filesystems.  "
"Older kernels, or kernels configured in certain ways, may not support this "
"combination.  The NFS protocol does not support passing the flag to the "
"server, so B<O_DIRECT> I/O will bypass the page cache only on the client; "
"the server may still cache the I/O.  The client asks the server to make the "
"I/O synchronous to preserve the synchronous semantics of B<O_DIRECT>.  Some "
"servers will perform poorly under these circumstances, especially if the I/O "
"size is small.  Some servers may also be configured to lie to clients about "
"the I/O having reached stable storage; this will avoid the performance "
"penalty at some risk to data integrity in the event of server power "
"failure.  The Linux NFS client places no alignment restrictions on "
"B<O_DIRECT> I/O."
