#.  Linus: Now, imagine using the above in a media server, for example.
#.  Let's say that a year or two has passed, so that the video drivers
#.  have been updated to be able to do the splice thing, and what can
#.  you do? You can:
#.  - splice from the (mpeg or whatever - let's just assume that the video
#.    input is either digital or does the encoding on its own - like they
#.    pretty much all do) video input into a pipe (remember: no copies - the
#.    video input will just DMA directly into memory, and splice will just
#.    set up the pages in the pipe buffer)
#.  - tee that pipe to split it up
#.  - splice one end to a file (ie "save the compressed stream to disk")
#.  - splice the other end to a real-time video decoder window for your
#.    real-time viewing pleasure.
#.  Linus: Now, the advantage of splice()/tee() is that you can
#.  do zero-copy movement of data, and unlike sendfile() you can
#.  do it on _arbitrary_ data (and, as shown by "tee()", it's more
#.  than just sending the data to somebody else: you can duplicate
#.  the data and choose to forward it to two or more different
#.  users - for things like logging etc.).
