#
#.  commit 98382f419f32d2c12d021943b87dea555677144b
#.      net: Cap number of elements for sendmmsg
#.      To limit the amount of time we can spend in sendmmsg, cap the
#.      number of elements to UIO_MAXIOV (currently 1024).
#.      For error handling an application using sendmmsg needs to retry at
#.      the first unsent message, so capping is simpler and requires less
#.      application logic than returning EINVAL.
