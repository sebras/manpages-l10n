#.  In the initial implementation, it was the case that:
#.      In fact the whole process is switched to use 4 kB hardware pages when the
#.      subpage_prot system call is used, but this could be improved in future
#.      to switch only the affected segments.
#.  But Paul Mackerass says (Oct 2010): I'm pretty sure we now only switch
#.  the affected segment, not the whole process.

"This system call is provided to assist writing emulators that operate using "
"64-kB pages on PowerPC systems.  When emulating systems such as x86, which "
"uses a smaller page size, the emulator can no longer use the memory-"
"management unit (MMU)  and normal system calls for controlling page "
"protections.  (The emulator could emulate the MMU by checking and possibly "
"remapping the address for each memory access in software, but that is "
"slow.)  The idea is that the emulator supplies an array of protection masks "
"to apply to a specified range of virtual addresses.  These masks are applied "
"at the level where hardware page-table entries (PTEs)  are inserted into the "
"hardware page table based on the Linux PTEs, so the Linux PTEs are not "
"affected.  Implicit in this is that the regions of the address space that "
"are protected are switched to use 4-kB hardware pages rather than 64-kB "
"hardware pages (on machines with hardware 64-kB page support)."
