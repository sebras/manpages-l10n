"When a process terminates, its set of associated I<semadj> structures is "
"used to undo the effect of all of the semaphore operations it performed with "
"the B<SEM_UNDO> flag.  This raises a difficulty: if one (or more) of these "
"semaphore adjustments would result in an attempt to decrease a semaphore's "
"value below zero, what should an implementation do? One possible approach "
"would be to block until all the semaphore adjustments could be performed.  "
"This is however undesirable since it could force process termination to "
"block for arbitrarily long periods.  Another possibility is that such "
"semaphore adjustments could be ignored altogether (somewhat analogously to "
"failing when B<IPC_NOWAIT> is specified for a semaphore operation).  Linux "
"adopts a third approach: decreasing the semaphore value as far as possible "
"(i.e., to zero) and allowing process termination to proceed immediately."

"prevents a thread that is waiting for a semaphore value to become zero from "
