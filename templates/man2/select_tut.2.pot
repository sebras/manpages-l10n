"B<pselect>()  is useful if you are waiting for a signal as well as for file "
"descriptor(s) to become ready for I/O.  Programs that receive signals "
"normally use the signal handler only to raise a global flag.  The global "
"flag will indicate that the event must be processed in the main loop of the "
"program.  A signal will cause the B<select>()  (or B<pselect>())  call to "
"return with I<errno> set to B<EINTR>.  This behavior is essential so that "
"signals can be processed in the main loop of the program, otherwise "
"B<select>()  would block indefinitely."

"Now, somewhere in the main loop will be a conditional to check the global "
"flag.  So we must ask: what if a signal arrives after the conditional, but "
"before the B<select>()  call? The answer is that B<select>()  would block "
"indefinitely, even though an event is actually pending.  This race condition "
"is solved by the B<pselect>()  call.  This call can be used to set the "
"signal mask to a set of signals that are to be received only within the "
"B<pselect>()  call.  For instance, let us say that the event in question was "
"the exit of a child process.  Before the start of the main loop, we would "
"block B<SIGCHLD> using B<sigprocmask>(2).  Our B<pselect>()  call would "
"enable B<SIGCHLD> by using an empty signal mask.  Our program would look "

"So what is the point of B<select>()? Can't I just read and write to my file "

"multiple descriptors at the same time and properly puts the process to sleep "
"if there is no activity.  UNIX programmers often find themselves in a "
"position where they have to handle I/O from more than one file descriptor "
"where the data flow may be intermittent.  If you were to merely create a "

"your calls may block waiting for data from/to a file descriptor, while "
"another file descriptor is unused though ready for I/O.  B<select>()  "

"B<pselect>()  is useful if you are waiting for a signal as well as for file "
