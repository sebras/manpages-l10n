"Using a statically sized buffer might not provide enough room for the "
"symbolic link contents.  The required size for the buffer can be obtained "
"from the I<stat.st_size> value returned by a call to B<lstat>(2)  on the "
"link.  However, the number of bytes written by B<readlink>()  and "
"B<readlinkat>()  should be checked to make sure that the size of the "
"symbolic link did not increase between the calls.  Dynamically allocating "
"the buffer for B<readlink>()  and B<readlinkat>()  also addresses a common "
"portability problem when using I<PATH_MAX> for the buffer size, as this "
"constant is not guaranteed to be defined per POSIX if the system does not "
"have such limit."
