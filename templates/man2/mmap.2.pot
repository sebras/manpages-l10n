"Shared file mappings with this flag provide the guarantee that while some "
"memory is writably mapped in the address space of the process, it will be "
"visible in the same file at the same offset even after the system crashes or "
"is rebooted.  In conjunction with the use of appropriate CPU instructions, "
"this provides users of such mappings with a more efficient way of making "
"data modifications persistent."

"For example, suppose that thread A looks through I</proc/E<lt>pidE<gt>/maps> "
"and in order to locate an unused address range that it can map using "
"B<MAP_FIXED>, while thread B simultaneously acquires part or all of that "
"same address range.  When thread A subsequently employs B<mmap(MAP_FIXED)>, "
"it will effectively clobber the mapping that thread B created.  In this "
"scenario, thread B need not create a mapping directly; simply making a "
"library call that, internally, uses B<dlopen>(3)  to load some other shared "
"library, will suffice.  The B<dlopen>(3)  call will map the library into the "
"process's address space.  Furthermore, almost any library call may be "
"implemented in a way that adds memory mappings to the address space, either "
"with this technique, or by simply allocating memory.  Examples include "
"B<brk>(2), B<malloc>(3), B<pthread_create>(3), and the PAM libraries E<.UR "
