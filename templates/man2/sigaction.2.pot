#.  FIXME .
#.  When si_utime and si_stime where originally implemented, the
#.  measurement unit was HZ, which was the same as clock ticks
#.  (sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  In 2.6, HZ became configurable, and
#.  was *still* used as the unit to return the info these fields,
#.  with the result that the field values depended on the
#.  configured HZ.  Of course, the should have been measured in
#.  USER_HZ instead, so that sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) could be used to
#.  convert to seconds.  I have a queued patch to fix this:
#.  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/698061/ .
#.  This patch made it into 2.6.27.
#.  But note that these fields still don't return the times of
#.  waited-for children (as is done by getrusage() and times()
#.  and wait4()).  Solaris 8 does include child times.
