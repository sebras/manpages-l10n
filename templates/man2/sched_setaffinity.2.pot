"A thread's CPU affinity mask determines the set of CPUs on which it is "
"eligible to run.  On a multiprocessor system, setting the CPU affinity mask "
"can be used to obtain performance benefits.  For example, by dedicating one "
"CPU to a particular thread (i.e., setting the affinity mask of that thread "
"to specify a single CPU, and setting the affinity mask of all other threads "
"to exclude that CPU), it is possible to ensure maximum execution speed for "
"that thread.  Restricting a thread to run on a single CPU also avoids the "
"performance cost caused by the cache invalidation that occurs when a thread "
"ceases to execute on one CPU and then recommences execution on a different "
"CPU."
