"The program below takes two arguments: a sleep period in seconds, and a "
"timer frequency in nanoseconds.  The program establishes a handler for the "
"signal it uses for the timer, blocks that signal, creates and arms a timer "
"that expires with the given frequency, sleeps for the specified number of "
"seconds, and then unblocks the timer signal.  Assuming that the timer "
"expired at least once while the program slept, the signal handler will be "
"invoked, and the handler displays some information about the timer "
"notification.  The program terminates after one invocation of the signal "
