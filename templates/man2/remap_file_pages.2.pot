"B<Note>: this system call was marked as deprecated starting with Linux "
"3.16.  In Linux 4.0, the implementation was replaced by a slower in-kernel "
"emulation.  Those few applications that use this system call should consider "
"migrating to alternatives.  This change was made because the kernel code for "
"this system call was complex, and it is believed to be little used or "

"applications on 32-bit systems, those use cases don't exist on 64-bit "
