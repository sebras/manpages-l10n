#.  See http://lwn.net/Articles/171941/
#.  [PATCH] madvise MADV_DONTFORK/MADV_DOFORK
#.  Currently, copy-on-write may change the physical address of
#.  a page even if the user requested that the page is pinned in
#.  memory (either by mlock or by get_user_pages).  This happens
#.  if the process forks meanwhile, and the parent writes to that
#.  page.  As a result, the page is orphaned: in case of
#.  get_user_pages, the application will never see any data hardware
#.  DMA's into this page after the COW.  In case of mlock'd memory,
#.  the parent is not getting the realtime/security benefits of mlock.
#.  In particular, this affects the Infiniband modules which do DMA from
#.  and into user pages all the time.
#.  This patch adds madvise options to control whether memory range is
#.  inherited across fork. Useful e.g. for when hardware is doing DMA
#.  from/into these pages.  Could also be useful to an application
#.  wanting to speed up its forks by cutting large areas out of
#.  consideration.
