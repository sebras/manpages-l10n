"The quota system can be used to set per-user, per-group, and per-project "
"limits on the amount of disk space used on a filesystem.  For each user and/"
"or group, a soft limit and a hard limit can be set for each filesystem.  The "
"hard limit can't be exceeded.  The soft limit can be exceeded, but warnings "
"will ensue.  Moreover, the user can't exceed the soft limit for more than "
"grace period duration (one week by default) at a time; after this, the soft "
