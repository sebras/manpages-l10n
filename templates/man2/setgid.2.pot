"At the kernel level, user IDs and group IDs are a per-thread attribute.  "
"However, POSIX requires that all threads in a process share the same "
"credentials.  The NPTL threading implementation handles the POSIX "
"requirements by providing wrapper functions for the various system calls "
"that change process UIDs and GIDs.  These wrapper functions (including the "
"one for B<setgid>())  employ a signal-based technique to ensure that when "
"one thread changes credentials, all of the other threads in the process also "
"change their credentials.  For details, see B<nptl>(7)."
