#.  From an Aug 2015 conversation with Kees Cook where I asked why *all*
#.  filters are applied even if one of the early filters returns
#.  SECCOMP_RET_KILL:
#.      It's just because it would be an optimization that would only speed up
#.      the RET_KILL case, but it's the uncommon one and the one that doesn't
#.      benefit meaningfully from such a change (you need to kill the process
#.      really quickly?). We would speed up killing a program at the (albeit
#.      tiny) expense to all other filtered programs. Best to keep the filter
#.      execution logic clear, simple, and as fast as possible for all
#.      filters.
