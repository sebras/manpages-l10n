"If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between multiple "
"files, this B<ioctl>(2)  operation can be used to make some of the data in "
"the B<src_fd> file appear in the B<dest_fd> file by sharing the underlying "
"storage if the file data is identical (\"deduplication\").  Both files must "
"reside within the same filesystem.  This reduces storage consumption by "
"allowing the filesystem to store one shared copy of the data.  If a file "
"write should occur to a shared region, the filesystem must ensure that the "
"changes remain private to the file being written.  This behavior is commonly "
"referred to as \"copy on write\"."
