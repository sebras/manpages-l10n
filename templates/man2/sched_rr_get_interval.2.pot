"POSIX does not specify any mechanism for controlling the size of the round-"
"robin time quantum.  Older Linux kernels provide a (nonportable) method of "
"doing this.  The quantum can be controlled by adjusting the process's nice "
"value (see B<setpriority>(2)).  Assigning a negative (i.e., high) nice value "
