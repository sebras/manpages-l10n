"Whether B<getpagesize>()  is present as a Linux system call depends on the "
"architecture.  If it is, it returns the kernel symbol B<PAGE_SIZE>, whose "
"value depends on the architecture and machine model.  Generally, one uses "
"binaries that are dependent on the architecture but not on the machine "
"model, in order to have a single binary distribution per architecture.  This "
"means that a user program should not find B<PAGE_SIZE> at compile time from "
"a header file, but use an actual system call, at least for those "
"architectures (like sun4) where this dependency exists.  Here glibc 2.0 "
"fails because its B<getpagesize>()  returns a statically derived value, and "
"does not use a system call.  Things are OK in glibc 2.1."
