msgstr ""

#.  Linus: vmsplice() system call to basically do a "write to
#.  the buffer", but using the reference counting and VM traversal
#.  to actually fill the buffer. This means that the user needs to
#.  be careful not to reuse the user-space buffer it spliced into
#.  the kernel-space one (contrast this to "write()", which copies
#.  the actual data, and you can thus reuse the buffer immediately
#.  after a successful write), but that is often easy to do.
#.  Since Linux 2.6.23
#.  commit 6a14b90bb6bc7cd83e2a444bf457a2ea645cbfe7
