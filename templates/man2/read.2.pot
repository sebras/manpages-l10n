"Among the APIs subsequently listed are B<read>()  and B<readv>(2).  And "
"among the effects that should be atomic across threads (and processes)  are "
"updates of the file offset.  However, on Linux before version 3.14, this was "
"not the case: if two processes that share an open file description (see "
"B<open>(2))  perform a B<read>()  (or B<readv>(2))  at the same time, then "
"the I/O operations were not atomic with respect updating the file offset, "
"with the result that the reads in the two processes might (incorrectly) "
"overlap in the blocks of data that they obtained.  This problem was fixed in "
"Linux 3.14."
