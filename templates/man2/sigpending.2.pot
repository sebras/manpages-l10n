"The original Linux system call was named B<sigpending>().  However, with the "
"addition of real-time signals in Linux 2.2, the fixed-size, 32-bit "
"I<sigset_t> argument supported by that system call was no longer fit for "
"purpose.  Consequently, a new system call, B<rt_sigpending>(), was added to "
"support an enlarged I<sigset_t> type.  The new system call takes a second "
"argument, I<size_t sigsetsize>, which specifies the size in bytes of the "
"signal set in I<set>.  The glibc B<sigpending>()  wrapper function hides "
"these details from us, transparently calling B<rt_sigpending>()  when the "
