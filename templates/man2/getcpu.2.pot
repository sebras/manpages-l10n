#.  .I tcache
#.  is a pointer to a
#.  .IR "struct getcpu_cache"
#.  that is used as a cache by
#.  .BR getcpu ().
#.  The caller should put the cache into a thread-local variable
#.  if the process is multithreaded,
#.  because the cache cannot be shared between different threads.
#.  .I tcache
#.  can be NULL.
#.  If it is not NULL
#.  .BR getcpu ()
#.  will use it to speed up operation.
#.  The information inside the cache is private to the system call
#.  and should not be accessed by the user program.
#.  The information placed in the cache can change between kernel releases.
#.  When no cache is specified
#.  .BR getcpu ()
#.  will be slower,
#.  but always retrieve the current CPU and node information.
#.  With a cache
#.  .BR getcpu ()
#.  is faster.
#.  However, the cached information is updated only once per jiffy (see
#.  .BR time (7)).
#.  This means that the information could theoretically be out of date,
#.  although in practice the scheduler's attempt to maintain
#.  soft CPU affinity means that the information is unlikely to change
#.  over the course of the caching interval.
