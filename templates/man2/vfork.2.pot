"Under Linux, B<fork>(2)  is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the "
"only penalty incurred by B<fork>(2)  is the time and memory required to "
"duplicate the parent's page tables, and to create a unique task structure "
"for the child.  However, in the bad old days a B<fork>(2)  would require "
"making a complete copy of the caller's data space, often needlessly, since "
"usually immediately afterward an B<exec>(3)  is done.  Thus, for greater "
"efficiency, BSD introduced the B<vfork>()  system call, which did not fully "
"copy the address space of the parent process, but borrowed the parent's "
"memory and thread of control until a call to B<execve>(2)  or an exit "
"occurred.  The parent process was suspended while the child was using its "
"resources.  The use of B<vfork>()  was tricky: for example, not modifying "
"data in the parent process depended on knowing which variables were held in "
"a register."
