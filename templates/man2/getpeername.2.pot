"For stream sockets, once a B<connect>(2)  has been performed, either socket "

"B<getpeername>()  to obtain the peer address that it earlier set for the "
"socket.  However, the peer socket is unaware of this information, and "
"calling B<getpeername>()  on the peer socket will return no useful "
"information (unless a B<connect>(2)  call was also executed on the peer).  "
"Note also that the receiver of a datagram can obtain the address of the "
