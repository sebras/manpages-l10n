"When expiration notifications are delivered via a signal, overruns can occur "

"timer notifications, the system queues at most one signal per timer.  (This "
"is the behavior specified by POSIX.1.  The alternative, queuing one signal "
"for each timer expiration, could easily result in overflowing the allowed "
"limits for queued signals on the system.)  Because of system scheduling "
"delays, or because the signal may be temporarily blocked, there can be a "
"delay between the time when the notification signal is generated and the "
"time when it is delivered (e.g., caught by a signal handler) or accepted (e."
"g., using B<sigwaitinfo>(2)).  In this interval, further timer expirations "
"may occur.  The timer overrun count is the number of additional timer "
"expirations that occurred between the time when the signal was generated and "
"when it was delivered or accepted."
