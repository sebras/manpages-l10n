"that of the created/deleted/moved directory entry.  The event B<FAN_RENAME> "

"directory file handle can be passed to B<open_by_handle_at>(2)  to get an "
"open directory file descriptor and that file descriptor along with the "

"B<FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME>: if a non-directory object has no parent, "
"either the event will not be reported or it will be reported without the "
"directory entry information.  Note that there is no guarantee that the "

"entry information at the time the event is received.  See B<fanotify>(7)  "
