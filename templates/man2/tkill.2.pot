"in the thread group I<tgid>.  (By contrast, B<kill>(2)  can be used to send "
"a signal only to a process (i.e., thread group)  as a whole, and the signal "

#.  FIXME Maybe say something about the following:
#.  http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12889
#.  Quoting Rich Felker <bugdal@aerifal.cx>:
#.  There is a race condition in pthread_kill: it is possible that,
#.  between the time pthread_kill reads the pid/tid from the target
#.  thread descriptor and the time it makes the tgkill syscall,
#.  the target thread terminates and the same tid gets assigned
#.  to a new thread in the same process.
#.  (The tgkill syscall was designed to eliminate a similar race
#.  condition in tkill, but it only succeeded in eliminating races
#.  where the tid gets reused in a different process, and does not
#.  help if the same tid gets assigned to a new thread in the
#.  same process.)
#.  The only solution I can see is to introduce a mutex that ensures
#.  that a thread cannot exit while pthread_kill is being called on it.
#.  Note that in most real-world situations, like almost all race
#.  conditions, this one will be extremely rare. To make it
#.  measurable, one could exhaust all but 1-2 available pid values,
#.  possibly by lowering the max pid parameter in /proc, forcing
#.  the same tid to be reused rapidly.
