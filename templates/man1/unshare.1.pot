"Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs have "

"to manage various aspects of the newly created namespaces (such as "
"configuring interfaces in the network namespace or mounting filesystems in "
"the mount namespace) even when run unprivileged.  As a mere convenience "
"feature, it does not support more sophisticated use cases, such as mapping "

"To be able to call B<setgroups>(2), the calling process must at least have "
"CAP_SETGID.  But since Linux 3.19 a further restriction applies: the kernel "
"gives permission to call B<\\%setgroups>(2)  only after the GID map (B</proc/"
">I<pid>B</gid_map>) has been set.  The GID map is writable by root when B<\\"
"%setgroups>(2)  is enabled (i.e. B<allow>, the default), and the GID map "
"becomes writable by unprivileged processes when B<\\%setgroups>(2)  is "
"permanently disabled (with B<deny>)."
