"B<vlock> is a program to lock one or more sessions on the Linux console.  "
"This is especially useful for Linux machines which have multiple users with "
"access to the console.  One user may lock his or her session(s) while still "
"allowing other users to use the system on other virtual consoles.  If "
"desired, the entire console may be locked and virtual console switching "
"disabled."

"By default, only the current VC (virtual console) is locked.  With the B<-a,-"
"all> option all VCs are locked.  The locked VCs cannot be unlocked without "
"the invoker's password.  And, for the paranoid, vlock makes it a trying "
"experience for those attempting to guess the password, so unauthorized "
"access to session(s) is highly unlikely."
