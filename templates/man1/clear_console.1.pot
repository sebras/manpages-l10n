"B<clear_console> clears your console if this is possible.  It looks in the "
"environment for the terminal type and then in the B<terminfo> database to "
"figure out how to clear the screen. To clear the buffer, it then changes the "
"foreground virtual terminal to another terminal and then back to the "
"original terminal."
