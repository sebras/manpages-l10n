"B<scanimage> is a command-line interface to control image acquisition "
"devices such as flatbed scanners or cameras.  The device is controlled via "
"command-line options.  After command-line processing, B<scanimage> normally "
"proceeds to acquire an image.  The image data is written to standard output "
"in one of the PNM (portable aNyMaP) formats (PBM for black-and-white images, "
"PGM for grayscale images, and PPM for color images), TIFF format (black-and-"
"white, grayscale or color), PNG format, or JPEG format (compression level "
"75).  B<scanimage> accesses image acquisition devices through the B<SANE> "
"(Scanner Access Now Easy) interface and can thus support any device for "
"which there exists a B<SANE> backend (try B<apropos> I<sane-> to get a list "
"of available backends)."
