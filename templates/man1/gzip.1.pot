msgid ""
"The B<gzip> command reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv "
"coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the "
"extension B<\\&.gz>, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and "
"modification times.  (The default extension is B<z> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, "
"Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file name is "
"\"-\", the standard input is compressed to the standard output.  The B<gzip> "
"command will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it will "
"ignore symbolic links."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux mageia-cauldron
msgid ""
"If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, B<gzip> "
"truncates it.  The B<gzip> command attempts to truncate only the parts of "
"the file name longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If "
"the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For "
"example, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is "
"compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which do "
"not have a limit on file name length."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"By default, B<gzip> keeps the original file name and timestamp in the "
"compressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the B<-N> "
"option. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or when "
"the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Compressed files can be restored to their original form using B<gzip -d> or "
"B<gunzip> or B<zcat>.  If the original name saved in the compressed file is "

"original one to make it legal."

"B<gunzip> takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file "
"whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case)  and which "
"begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without the "
"original extension.  B<gunzip> also recognizes the special extensions B<\\&."
"tgz> and B<\\&.taz> as shorthands for B<\\&.tar.gz> and B<\\&.tar.Z> "

"B<gunzip> can currently decompress files created by B<gzip>, B<zip>, "
"B<compress>, B<compress -H> or B<pack>.  The detection of the input format "
"is automatic.  When using the first two formats, B<gunzip> checks a 32 bit "
"CRC. For B<pack> and B<gunzip> checks the uncompressed length. The standard "
"B<compress> format was not designed to allow consistency checks. However "
"B<gunzip> is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error "
"when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct "
"simply because the standard B<uncompress> does not complain. This generally "
"means that the standard B<uncompress> does not check its input, and happily "
"generates garbage output.  The SCO compress -H format (lzh compression "
"method) does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks."

"The B<gzip> command uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in B<zip> and PKZIP.  "
