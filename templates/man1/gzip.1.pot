"The B<gzip> command reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv "
"coding (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the "
"extension B<\\&.gz>, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and "
"modification times.  (The default extension is B<z> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, "
"Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file name is "
"\"-\", the standard input is compressed to the standard output.  The B<gzip> "
"command will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it will "
"ignore symbolic links."

"the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For "
