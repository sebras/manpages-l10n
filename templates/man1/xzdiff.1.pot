"B<xzcmp> and B<xzdiff> invoke B<cmp>(1)  or B<diff>(1)  on files compressed "
"with B<xz>(1), B<lzma>(1), B<gzip>(1), B<bzip2>(1), or B<lzop>(1).  All "
"options specified are passed directly to B<cmp>(1)  or B<diff>(1).  If only "
"one file is specified, then the files compared are I<file1> (which must have "
"a suffix of a supported compression format) and I<file1> from which the "
"compression format suffix has been stripped.  If two files are specified, "
"then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to B<cmp>(1)  or "
"B<diff>(1).  The exit status from B<cmp>(1)  or B<diff>(1)  is preserved."
