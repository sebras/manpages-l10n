"If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent. The default action for "
"this signal is to terminate the process. This signal should be used in "

"terminating in an orderly fashion. If a process does not terminate after a "
"TERM signal has been sent, then the KILL signal may be used; be aware that "
"the latter signal cannot be caught, and so does not give the target process "
