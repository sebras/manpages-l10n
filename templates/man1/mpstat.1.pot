"The B<mpstat> command writes to standard output activities for each "
"available processor, processor 0 being the first one.  Global average "
"activities among all processors are also reported.  The B<mpstat> command "
"can be used on both SMP and UP machines, but in the latter, only global "
"average activities will be printed. If no activity has been selected, then "
"the default report is the CPU utilization report."

"The I<interval> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between "
"each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all) indicates that "
"processors statistics are to be reported for the time since system startup "
"(boot). The I<count >parameter can be specified in conjunction with the "
"I<interval> parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of I<count> "
