"E<.Nm> is a script that uses E<.Xr ssh 1> to log into a remote machine "
"(presumably using a login password, so password authentication should be "
"enabled, unless you've done some clever use of multiple identities).  It "
"assembles a list of one or more fingerprints (as described below) and tries "
"to log in with each key, to see if any of them are already installed (of "
"course, if you are not using E<.Xr ssh-agent 1> this may result in you being "
"repeatedly prompted for pass-phrases).  It then assembles a list of those "
"that failed to log in, and using ssh, enables logins with those keys on the "
"remote server.  By default it adds the keys by appending them to the remote "
"user's E<.Pa ~/.ssh/authorized_keys> (creating the file, and directory, if "
"necessary).  It is also capable of detecting if the remote system is a "
"NetScreen, and using its E<.Ql set ssh pka-dsa key ...> command instead."
