"The B<zless> command is a filter which allows examination of compressed or "
"plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the "
"equivalent of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- "
"%s', and the environment variable LESSMETACHARS to "
"\\&'E<lt>spaceE<gt>E<lt>tabE<gt>E<lt>newlineE<gt>;*?\"()E<lt>E<gt>[|&^`#\\e$"
"%=~', and then running B<less>.  However, enough people seem to think that "
"having the command B<zless> available is important to be worth providing it."

"The B<zless> command does not work with compressed data that is piped to it "

"To read compressed data from a pipe, you can use .\\|.\\|.B<|gunzip|less> "
