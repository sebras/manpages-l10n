"This manual page documents the GNU version of B<chown>.  B<chown> changes "
"the user and/or group ownership of each given file.  If only an owner (a "
"user name or numeric user ID) is given, that user is made the owner of each "
"given file, and the files' group is not changed.  If the owner is followed "
"by a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between "
"them, the group ownership of the files is changed as well.  If a colon but "
"no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the "
"files and the group of the files is changed to that user's login group.  If "
"the colon and group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group of "
"the files is changed; in this case, B<chown> performs the same function as "
"B<chgrp>.  If only a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, "
"neither the owner nor the group is changed."
