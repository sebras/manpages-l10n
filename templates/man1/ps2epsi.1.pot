"B<ps2epsi> uses B<gs>(1) to process a B<PostScript>(tm) file and generate as "
"output a new file which conforms to Adobe's B<Encapsulated PostScript "
"Interchange> (EPSI) format.  EPSI is a special form of encapsulated "
"PostScript (EPS) which adds to the beginning of the file in the form of "
"PostScript comments a bitmapped version of the final displayed page.  "
"Programs which understand EPSI (usually word processors or DTP programs) can "
"use this bitmap to give a preview version on screen of the PostScript.  The "
"displayed quality is often not very good (e.g., low resolution, no colours), "
"but the final printed version uses the real PostScript, and thus has the "
"normal PostScript quality."

"Not every PostScript file can be encapsulated successfully, because there "
"are restrictions on what PostScript constructs a correct encapsulated file "
"may contain.  B<ps2epsi> does a little extra work to try to help "
"encapsulation, and it automatically calculates the bounding box required for "
"all encapsulated PostScript files, so most of the time it does a pretty good "
"job. There are certain to be cases, however, where the encapsulation does "
"not work because of the content of the original PostScript file."
