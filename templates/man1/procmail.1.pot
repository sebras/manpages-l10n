"B<Procmail> should be invoked automatically over the B<.forward> file "

"system administrator, it can be invoked from within the mailer immediately.  "
"When invoked, it first sets some environment variables to default values, "

"look for a file named B<$HOME/.procmailrc>.  According to the processing "
