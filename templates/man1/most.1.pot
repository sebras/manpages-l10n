msgid ""
"B<most> is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a time, the "
"contents of a file on a terminal.  It pauses after each windowful and prints "
"on the window status line the screen the file name, current line number, and "
"the percentage of the file so far displayed."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux fedora-37 fedora-rawhide mageia-cauldron opensuse-tumbleweed
msgid ""
"Unlike other paging programs, B<most> is capable of displaying an arbitrary "
"number of windows as long as each window occupies at least two screen "
"lines.  Each window may contain the same file or a different file.  In "
"addition, each window has its own mode.  For example, one window may display "
"a file with its lines wrapped while another may be truncating the lines. "
"Windows may be `locked' together in the sense that if one of the locked "
"windows scrolls, all locked windows will scroll.  B<most> is also capable of "
"ignoring lines that are indented beyond a user specified value.  This is "
"useful when viewing computer programs to pick out gross features of the "
"code.  See the `:o' command for a description of this feature."

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux fedora-37 fedora-rawhide mageia-cauldron opensuse-tumbleweed
msgid ""
"In addition to displaying ordinary text files, B<most> can also display "
"binary files as well as files with arbitrary ascii characters.  When a file "
"is read into a buffer, B<most> examines the first 32 bytes of the file to "
"determine if the file is a binary file and then switches to the appropriate "
"mode.  However, this feature may be disabled with the -k option.  See the "
"description of the -b, -k, -v, and -t options for further details."

"Text files may contain combinations of underscore and backspace characters "
"causing a printer to underline or overstrike.  When B<most> recognizes this, "
"it inserts the appropriate escape sequences to achieve the desired effect.  "
"In addition, some files cause the printer to overstrike some characters by "
"embedding carriage return characters in the middle of a line.  When this "
"occurs, B<most> displays the overstruck character with a bold attribute.  "
"This feature facilitates the reading of UNIX man pages or a document "
"produced by runoff.  In particular, viewing this document with B<most> "
"should illustrate this behavior provided that the underline characters have "
"not been stripped.  This may be turned off with the -v option."

"By default, lines with more characters than the terminal width are not "
"wrapped but are instead truncated. When truncation occurs, this is indicated "
"by a `$' in the far right column of the terminal screen.  The RIGHT and LEFT "
"arrow keys may be used to view lines which extend past the margins of the "
"screen.  The -w option may be used to override this feature.  When a window "
"is wrapped, the character `\\e' will appear at the right edge of the window."
