"Enables or disables a limit on the amount of recursion performed whilst "
"demangling strings.  Since the name mangling formats allow for an inifinite "
"level of recursion it is possible to create strings whose decoding will "
"exhaust the amount of stack space available on the host machine, triggering "
"a memory fault.  The limit tries to prevent this from happening by "
