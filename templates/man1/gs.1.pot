"The B<gs> (B<gswin32c>, B<gswin32>, B<gsos2>)  command invokes "
"B<Ghostscript>, an interpreter of Adobe Systems' B<PostScript>(tm) and "
"B<Portable Document Format> (PDF) languages.  B<gs> reads \"files\" in "
"sequence and executes them as Ghostscript programs. After doing this, it "
"reads further input from the standard input stream (normally the keyboard), "
"interpreting each line separately and output to an output device (may be a "
"file or an X11 window preview, see below). The interpreter exits gracefully "
"when it encounters the \"quit\" command (either in a file or from the "
"keyboard), at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such as Control-C at "
"the keyboard)."
