"The I<make> utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large "
"program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  "
"The manual describes the GNU implementation of B<make>, which was written by "
"Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul "
"Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you "
"can use B<make> with any programming language whose compiler can be run with "
"a shell command.  In fact, B<make> is not limited to programs.  You can use "
"it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from "
"others whenever the others change."
