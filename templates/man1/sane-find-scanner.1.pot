"B<sane-find-scanner> is a command-line tool to find SCSI and USB scanners "

"scanners can be detected by SANE backends."

"For B<SCSI> scanners, it checks the default generic SCSI device files (e.g., "
"I</dev/sg0>)  and I</dev/scanner>.  The test is done by sending a SCSI "
"inquiry command and looking for a device type of \"scanner\" or \"processor"
"\" (some old HP scanners seem to send \"processor\"). So B<sane-find-"
"scanner> will find any SCSI scanner connected to those default device files "
"even if it isn't supported by any SANE backend."

"For B<USB> scanners, first the USB kernel scanner device files (e.g.  I</dev/"
"usb/scanner0>), I</dev/usb/scanner>, and I</dev/usbscanner>)  are tested. "
"The files are opened and the vendor and device ids are determined, if the "
"operating system supports this feature. Currently USB scanners are only "
"found this way if they are supported by the Linux scanner module or the "
"FreeBSD or OpenBSD uscanner driver. After that test, B<sane-find-scanner> "
"tries to scan for USB devices found by the USB library libusb (if "
"available). There is no special USB class for scanners, so the heuristics "
"used to distinguish scanners from other USB devices is not perfect.  B<sane-"
"find-scanner> also tries to find out the type of USB chip used in the "
"scanner. If detected, it will be printed after the vendor and product ids.  "
"B<sane-find-scanner> will even find USB scanners, that are not supported by "
"any SANE backend."
