"The I<xhost> program is used to add and delete host names or user names to "
"the list allowed to make connections to the X server.  In the case of hosts, "
"this provides a rudimentary form of privacy control and security.  It is "
"only sufficient for a workstation (single user) environment, although it "
"does limit the worst abuses.  Environments which require more sophisticated "
"measures should implement the user-based mechanism or use the hooks in the "
"protocol for passing other authentication data to the server."
