#: debian-bullseye
msgid ""
"B<plocate> finds all files on the system matching the given pattern (or all "
"of the patterns if multiple are given). It does this by means of an index "
"made by B<plocate-build>(8), which in turn reads the database made by "
"B<updatedb>(8)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye
msgid ""
"plocate is largely compatible with B<mlocate>(1), and reuses its database to "
"create its index, but is significantly faster. In particular, it rarely "
"needs to scan through its entire database, unless the pattern is very short "
"(less than three bytes)  or you want to search for a regular expression. It "
"does not try to maintain compatibility with BSD locate, or non-UTF-8 "
"filenames and locales. Most I/O is done asynchronously, but the results are "
"synchronized so that output comes in the same order every time."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye
msgid ""
"When multiple patterns are given, B<plocate> will search for files that "
"match I<all> of them. This is the main incompatibility with B<mlocate>(1), "
"which searches for files that match one or more patterns, unless the -a "
"option is given."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: debian-bullseye debian-unstable
msgid ""
"By default, patterns are taken to be substrings to search for.  If at least "
"one non-escaped globbing metacharacter (*, ? or []) is given, that pattern "
"is instead taken to be a glob pattern (which means it needs to start and end "
"in * for a substring match). If B<--regexp> is given, patterns are instead "
"taken to be (non-anchored) POSIX basic regular expressions, and if B<--"
"regex> is given, patterns are taken to be POSIX extended regular "
"expressions.  All of this matches B<mlocate>(1)  behavior."

#. type: Plain text

"Like B<mlocate>(1), B<plocate> shows all files visible to the calling user "
"(by virtue of having read and execute permissions on all parent "
"directories), and none that are not, by means of running with the setgid bit "
"set to access the index (which is built as root), but by testing visibility "
"as the calling user."
