"I<Less> is a program similar to I<more>(1), but which allows backward "
"movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, I<less> does not "
"have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input "
"files it starts up faster than text editors like I<vi>(1).  I<Less> uses "
"termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of "
"terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a "
"hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen "
"are prefixed with a caret.)"

"Control and binary characters are displayed in standout (reverse video).  "

"displayed as a hex number in angle brackets.  This format can be changed by "

"\" and one character to select the display attribute: \"*k\" is blinking, "
"\"*d\" is bold, \"*u\" is underlined, \"*s\" is standout, and \"*n\" is "

"I<Less> is a program similar to I<more> (1), but it has many more features.  "
"I<Less> does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with "
"large input files it starts up faster than text editors like I<vi> (1).  "
"I<Less> uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a "
"variety of terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy "
"terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the "
