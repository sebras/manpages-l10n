msgid ""
"B<xzdec> is a liblzma-based decompression-only tool for B<.xz> (and only B<."
"xz>)  files.  B<xzdec> is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for "
"B<xz>(1)  in the most common situations where a script has been written to "
"use B<xz --decompress --stdout> (and possibly a few other commonly used "
"options) to decompress B<.xz> files.  B<lzmadec> is identical to B<xzdec> "
"except that B<lzmadec> supports B<.lzma> files instead of B<.xz> files."

"To reduce the size of the executable, B<xzdec> doesn't support "
"multithreading or localization, and doesn't read options from B<XZ_DEFAULTS> "
"and B<XZ_OPT> environment variables.  B<xzdec> doesn't support displaying "
"intermediate progress information: sending B<SIGINFO> to B<xzdec> does "
"nothing, but sending B<SIGUSR1> terminates the process instead of displaying "
"progress information."
