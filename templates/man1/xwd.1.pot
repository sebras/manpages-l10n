"I<Xwd> is an X Window System window dumping utility.  I<Xwd> allows X users "
"to store window images in a specially formatted dump file.  This file can "
"then be read by various other X utilities for redisplay, printing, editing, "
"formatting, archiving, image processing, etc.  The target window is selected "
"by clicking the pointer in the desired window.  The keyboard bell is rung "
"once at the beginning of the dump and twice when the dump is completed."
