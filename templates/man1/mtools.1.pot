"Mtools is a collection of tools to allow Unix systems to manipulate MS-DOS "
"files: read, write, and move around files on an MS-DOS file system "
"(typically a floppy disk).  Where reasonable, each program attempts to "
"emulate the MS-DOS equivalent command. However, unnecessary restrictions and "
"oddities of DOS are not emulated. For instance, it is possible to move "
