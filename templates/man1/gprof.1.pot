"The granularity of the sampling is shown, but remains statistical at best.  "
"We assume that the time for each execution of a function can be expressed by "
"the total time for the function divided by the number of times the function "
"is called.  Thus the time propagated along the call graph arcs to the "
"function's parents is directly proportional to the number of times that arc "
"is traversed."

"Parents that are not themselves profiled will have the time of their "

"spontaneously invoked in the call graph listing, and will not have their "
"time propagated further.  Similarly, signal catchers, even though profiled, "
"will appear to be spontaneous (although for more obscure reasons).  Any "
"profiled children of signal catchers should have their times propagated "
"properly, unless the signal catcher was invoked during the execution of the "
"profiling routine, in which case all is lost."
