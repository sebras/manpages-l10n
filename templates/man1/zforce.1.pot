"The B<zforce> command forces a B<.gz> extension on all B<gzip> files so that "
"B<gzip> will not compress them twice.  This can be useful for files with "
"names truncated after a file transfer.  On systems with a 14 char limitation "
"on file names, the original name is truncated to make room for the .gz "
"suffix. For example, 12345678901234 is renamed to 12345678901.gz. A file "
"name such as foo.tgz is left intact."
