"E<.Nm> is a utility for gathering the public SSH host keys of a number of "
"hosts.  It was designed to aid in building and verifying E<.Pa "
"ssh_known_hosts> files, the format of which is documented in E<.Xr sshd 8>.  "
"E<.Nm> provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and perl "
"scripts."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"E<.Nm> uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in "
"parallel, so it is very efficient.  The keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts "
"can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those hosts are down "
"or do not run E<.Xr sshd 8>.  For scanning, one does not need login access "
"to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning process "
"involve any encryption."
