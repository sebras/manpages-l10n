"B<hardlink> is a tool that replaces copies of a file with either hardlinks "
"or copy-on-write clones, thus saving space."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: archlinux debian-unstable fedora-rawhide mageia-cauldron
msgid ""
"B<hardlink> first creates a binary tree of file sizes and then compares the "
"content of files that have the same size. There are two basic content "
"comparison methods. The B<memcmp> method directly reads data blocks from "
"files and compares them. The other method is based on checksums (like "
"SHA256); in this case for each data block a checksum is calculated by the "
"Linux kernel crypto API, and this checksum is stored in userspace and used "
"for file comparisons."

#. type: Plain text

"For each file also an \"intro\" buffer (32 bytes) is cached. This buffer is "
"used independently from the comparison method and requested cache-size and "
"io-size.  The \"intro\" buffer dramatically reduces operations with data "
"content as files are very often different from the beginning."

"B<hardlink> creates a binary tree from file sizes and after that, it "
"compares files with the same sizes. There are two basic content comparison "
"methods. B<memcmp> method directly reads data blocks from files and compares "
"them. The other method is based on checksums (like SHA256), in this case for "
"each data block is calculated checksum by Linux kernel crypto API, and this "
"checksum is stored in userspace and used for files comparison. For each file "
"is also cached \"intro\" buffer (32 bytes), this buffer is used "
"independently on the comparison method and requested cache-size and io-size. "
"The \"intro\" buffer dramatically reduces operations with data content as "
"files are very often different from the beginning."
