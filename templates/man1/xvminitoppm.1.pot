"A program of this name was written in 1993 by Ingo Wilken and was part of "
"Netpbm until Release 10.34 (April 2006).  At that time, it was replaced in "
"Netpbm by the current program, which was written by Bryan Henderson.  The "
"function of the newer program is identical to that of the older one; the "
"reason for the replacement is that the newer one is easier to maintain."
