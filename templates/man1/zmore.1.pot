"The I<zmore> command is a filter which allows examination of compressed or "
"plain text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  The "
"B<zmore> command works on files compressed with B<compress>, B<pack> or "
"B<gzip>, and also on uncompressed files.  If a file does not exist, B<zmore> "
"looks for a file of the same name with the addition of a .gz, .z or .Z "
"suffix."
