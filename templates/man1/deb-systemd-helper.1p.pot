"\\&B<deb-systemd-helper> is a Debian-specific helper script which re-"

"The \\*(L\"enable\\*(R\" action will only be performed once (when first "

"The \\*(L\"was-enabled\\*(R\" action is not present in systemctl, but is "

"The \\*(L\"update-state\\*(R\" action is also not present in systemctl. It "
"updates \\&B<deb-systemd-helper>'s state file, removing obsolete entries (e."

"entries (e.g.  new service files shipped by the package) without enabling "

"or not bother about the systemd enabled state in case they are not running "
