"B<bashbug> is a shell script to help the user compose and mail bug reports "

"specified by the environment variable E<.SM> B<EDITOR> on a temporary copy "
"of the bug report format outline. The user must fill in the appropriate "
"fields and exit the editor.  B<bashbug> then mails the completed report to "
"I<bug-bash@gnu.org>, or I<email-address>.  If the report cannot be mailed, "
"it is saved in the file I<dead.bashbug> in the invoking user's home "
