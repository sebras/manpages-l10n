"The B<uuidgen> program creates (and prints) a new universally unique "
"identifier (UUID) using the B<libuuid>(3) library. The new UUID can "
"reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created on the local system, "
"and among UUIDs created on other systems in the past and in the future."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"There are three types of UUIDs which B<uuidgen> can generate: time-based "
"UUIDs, random-based UUIDs, and hash-based UUIDs. By default B<uuidgen> will "
"generate a random-based UUID if a high-quality random number generator is "
"present. Otherwise, it will choose a time-based UUID. It is possible to "
"force the generation of one of these first two UUID types by using the B<--"
"random> or B<--time> options."

"The third type of UUID is generated with the B<--md5> or B<--sha1> options, "
"followed by B<--namespace> I<namespace> and B<--name> I<name>. The "

"well-known UUIDs defined in RFC 4122, that is B<@dns>, B<@url>, B<@oid>, or "
"B<@x500>. The I<name> is an arbitrary string value. The generated UUID is "
"the digest of the concatenation of the namespace UUID and the name value, "
"hashed with the MD5 or SHA1 algorithms. It is, therefore, a predictable "
"value which may be useful when UUIDs are being used as handles or nonces for "
"more complex values or values which shouldn\\(cqt be disclosed directly. See "
