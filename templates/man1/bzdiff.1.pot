"I<Bzcmp> and I<bzdiff> are used to invoke the I<cmp> or the I<diff> program "
"on bzip2 compressed files.  All options specified are passed directly to "
"I<cmp> or I<diff>.  If only 1 file is specified, then the files compared are "
"I<file1> and an uncompressed I<file1>.bz2.  If two files are specified, then "
"they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to I<cmp> or I<diff>.  The exit "
"status from I<cmp> or I<diff> is preserved."
