#.  There
#.  are various function groups which can be identified by a letter which
#.  is appended to the chapter number:
#.  .IP (3C)
#.  These functions, the functions from chapter 2 and from chapter 3S are
#.  contained in the C standard library libc, which will be used by
#.  .BR cc (1)
#.  by default.
#.  .IP (3S)
#.  These functions are parts of the
#.  .BR stdio (3)
#.  library.  They are contained in the standard C library libc.
#.  .IP (3M)
#.  These functions are contained in the arithmetic library libm.  They are
#.  used by the
#.  .BR f77 (1)
#.  FORTRAN compiler by default, but not by the
#.  .BR cc (1)
#.  C compiler, which needs the option \fI\-lm\fP.
#.  .IP (3F)
#.  These functions are part of the FORTRAN library libF77.  There are no
#.  special compiler flags needed to use these functions.
#.  .IP (3X)
#.  Various special libraries.  The manual pages documenting their functions
#.  specify the library names.
