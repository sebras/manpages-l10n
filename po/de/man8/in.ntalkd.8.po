"E<.Nm Talkd> is the server that notifies a user that someone else wants to "
"initiate a conversation.  It acts a repository of invitations, responding to "
"requests by clients wishing to rendezvous to hold a conversation.  In normal "
"operation, a client, the caller, initiates a rendezvous by sending a E<.Tn "
"CTL_MSG> to the server of type E<.Tn LOOK_UP> (see E<.Aq Pa protocols/talkd."
"h>).  This causes the server to search its invitation tables to check if an "
"invitation currently exists for the caller (to speak to the callee specified "
"in the message).  If the lookup fails, the caller then sends an E<.Tn "
"ANNOUNCE> message causing the server to broadcast an announcement on the "
"callee's login ports requesting contact.  When the callee responds, the "
"local server uses the recorded invitation to respond with the appropriate "
"rendezvous address and the caller and callee client programs establish a "
"stream connection through which the conversation takes place."
