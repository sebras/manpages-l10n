"On systems with kernels compiled with built in support for cpusets, all "
"processes are attached to a cpuset, and cpusets are always present.  If a "
"system supports cpusets, then it will have the entry B<nodev cpuset> in the "
"file I</proc/filesystems>.  By mounting the cpuset filesystem (see the "
"B<EXAMPLE> section below), the administrator can configure the cpusets on a "
"system to control the processor and memory placement of processes on that "
"system.  By default, if the cpuset configuration on a system is not modified "
"or if the cpuset filesystem is not even mounted, then the cpuset mechanism, "
"though present, has no effect on the system's behavior."
