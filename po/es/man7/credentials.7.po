"Supplementary group IDs.  This is a set of additional group IDs that are "
"used for permission checks when accessing files and other shared resources.  "
"On Linux kernels before 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to 32 "
"supplementary groups; since kernel 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to "
"65536 supplementary groups.  The call I<sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX)> can be "
"used to determine the number of supplementary groups of which a process may "
"be a member.  A process can obtain its set of supplementary group IDs using "
"B<getgroups>(2), and can modify the set using B<setgroups>(2)."
