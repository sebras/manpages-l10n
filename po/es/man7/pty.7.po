"The slave end of the pseudoterminal provides an interface that behaves "

"by a program that has opened the master end.  Anything that is written on "
"the master end is provided to the process on the slave end as though it was "
"input typed on a terminal.  For example, writing the interrupt character "
"(usually control-C)  to the master device would cause an interrupt signal "
"(B<SIGINT>)  to be generated for the foreground process group that is "
"connected to the slave.  Conversely, anything that is written to the slave "
"end of the pseudoterminal can be read by the process that is connected to "
