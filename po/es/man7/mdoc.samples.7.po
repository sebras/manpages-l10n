"A tutorial sampler for writing E<.Bx> manual pages with the E<.Nm \\-mdoc> "
"macro package, a E<.Em content Ns \\-based> and E<.Em domain Ns \\-based> "
"formatting package for E<.Xr troff 1>.  Its predecessor, the E<.Xr \\-man 7> "
"package, addressed page layout, leaving the manipulation of fonts and other "
"typesetting details to the individual author.  In E<.Nm \\-mdoc>, page "
"layout macros make up the E<.Em \"page structure domain\"> which consists of "
"macros for titles, section headers, displays and lists.  Essentially items "
"which affect the physical position of text on a formatted page.  In addition "
"to the page structure domain, there are two more domains, the manual domain "
"and the general text domain.  The general text domain is defined as macros "
"which perform tasks such as quoting or emphasizing pieces of text.  The "
"manual domain is defined as macros that are a subset of the day to day "
"informal language used to describe commands, routines and related E<.Bx> "
"files.  Macros in the manual domain handle command names, command-line "
"arguments and options, function names, function parameters, pathnames, "
"variables, cross references to other manual pages, and so on.  These domain "
"items have value for both the author and the future user of the manual "
"page.  It is hoped the consistency gained across the manual set will provide "
"easier translation to future documentation tools."
