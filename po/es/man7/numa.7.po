"Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) refers to multiprocessor systems whose "
"memory is divided into multiple memory nodes.  The access time of a memory "
"node depends on the relative locations of the accessing CPU and the accessed "
"node.  (This contrasts with a symmetric multiprocessor system, where the "
"access time for all of the memory is the same for all CPUs.)  Normally, each "
"CPU on a NUMA system has a local memory node whose contents can be accessed "
"faster than the memory in the node local to another CPU or the memory on a "
"bus shared by all CPUs."
