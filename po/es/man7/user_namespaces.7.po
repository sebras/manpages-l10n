"As at Linux 3.8, most relevant subsystems supported user namespaces, but a "
"number of filesystems did not have the infrastructure needed to map user and "
"group IDs between user namespaces.  Linux 3.9 added the required "
"infrastructure support for many of the remaining unsupported filesystems "
"(Plan 9 (9P), Andrew File System (AFS), Ceph, CIFS, CODA, NFS, and OCFS2).  "
"Linux 3.12 added support the last of the unsupported major filesystems, XFS."
