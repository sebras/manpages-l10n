#.  FIXME . http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12002,
#.  filed 2010-09-10, may cause SIOCINQ to be defined in glibc headers
#.  SIOCOUTQ also has an effect for UNIX domain sockets, but not
#.  quite what userland might expect. It seems to return the number
#.  of bytes allocated for buffers containing pending output.
#.  That number is normally larger than the number of bytes of pending
#.  output. Since this info is, from userland's point of view, imprecise,
#.  and it may well change, probably best not to document this now.
