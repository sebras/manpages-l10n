#.  Mike Galbraith, 25 Nov 2016:
#.      I'd say something more wishy-washy here, like cycles are
#.      distributed fairly across groups and leave it at that, as your
#.      detailed example is incorrect due to SMP fairness (which I don't
#.      like much because [very unlikely] worst case scenario
#.      renders a box sized group incapable of utilizing more that
#.      a single CPU total).  For example, if a group of NR_CPUS
#.      size competes with a singleton, load balancing will try to give
#.      the singleton a full CPU of its very own.  If groups intersect for
#.      whatever reason on say my quad lappy, distribution is 80/20 in
#.      favor of the singleton.
