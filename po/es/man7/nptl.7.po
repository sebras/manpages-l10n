"NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers "
"32 and 33).  One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and "
"POSIX timers (see B<timer_create>(2)); the other is used as part of a "
"mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have the same UIDs "
"and GIDs, as required by POSIX.  These signals cannot be used in "
