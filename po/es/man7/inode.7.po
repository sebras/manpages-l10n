"The set-group-ID bit (B<S_ISGID>)  has several special uses.  For a "
"directory, it indicates that BSD semantics is to be used for that directory: "
"files created there inherit their group ID from the directory, not from the "
"effective group ID of the creating process, and directories created there "
"will also get the B<S_ISGID> bit set.  For a file that does not have the "
"group execution bit (B<S_IXGRP>)  set, the set-group-ID bit indicates "
"mandatory file/record locking."
