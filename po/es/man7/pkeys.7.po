"Applications should be very careful to ensure that they do not \"leak\" "

"application should be sure that no memory has that pkey assigned.  If the "
"application left the freed pkey assigned, a future user of that pkey might "
"inadvertently change the permissions of an unrelated data structure, which "
"could impact security or stability.  The kernel currently allows in-use "
"pkeys to have B<pkey_free>(2)  called on them because it would have "
"processor or memory performance implications to perform the additional "
"checks needed to disallow it.  Implementation of the necessary checks is "
"left up to applications.  Applications may implement these checks by "
"searching the I</proc/[pid]/smaps> file for memory regions with the pkey "
"assigned.  Further details can be found in B<proc>(5)."
