"System calls are generally not invoked directly, but rather via wrapper "
"functions in glibc (or perhaps some other library).  For details of direct "
"invocation of a system call, see B<intro>(2).  Often, but not always, the "
"name of the wrapper function is the same as the name of the system call that "
"it invokes.  For example, glibc contains a function B<chdir>()  which "
"invokes the underlying \"chdir\" system call."

"Often the glibc wrapper function is quite thin, doing little work other than "
"copying arguments to the right registers before invoking the system call, "
"and then setting I<errno> appropriately after the system call has returned.  "
"(These are the same steps that are performed by B<syscall>(2), which can be "
"used to invoke system calls for which no wrapper function is provided.)  "
"Note: system calls indicate a failure by returning a negative error number "
"to the caller on architectures without a separate error register/flag, as "
"noted in B<syscall>(2); when this happens, the wrapper function negates the "
"returned error number (to make it positive), copies it to I<errno>, and "
"returns -1 to the caller of the wrapper."

"Sometimes, however, the wrapper function does some extra work before "
"invoking the system call.  For example, nowadays there are (for reasons "
"described below) two related system calls, B<truncate>(2)  and "
"B<truncate64>(2), and the glibc B<truncate>()  wrapper function checks which "
"of those system calls are provided by the kernel and determines which should "
