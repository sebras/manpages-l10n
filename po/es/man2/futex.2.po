"The B<futex>()  system call provides a method for waiting until a certain "
"condition becomes true.  It is typically used as a blocking construct in the "
"context of shared-memory synchronization.  When using futexes, the majority "
"of the synchronization operations are performed in user space.  A user-space "
"program employs the B<futex>()  system call only when it is likely that the "
"program has to block for a longer time until the condition becomes true.  "
"Other B<futex>()  operations can be used to wake any processes or threads "
"waiting for a particular condition."

#.  Notes from Darren Hart (Dec 2015):
#.      Totally ordered with respect futex operations refers to semantics
#.      of the ACQUIRE/RELEASE operations and how they impact ordering of
#.      memory reads and writes. The kernel futex operations are protected
#.      by spinlocks, which ensure that all operations are serialized
#.      with respect to one another.
#.      This is a lot to attempt to define in this document. Perhaps a
#.      reference to linux/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt as a footnote
#.      would be sufficient? Or perhaps for this manual, "serialized" would
#.      be sufficient, with a footnote regarding "totally ordered" and a
#.      pointer to the memory-barrier documentation?
#.  FIXME(Torvald Riegel):
#.  Eventually we want to have some text in NOTES to satisfy
#.  the reference in the following sentence
#.      See NOTES for a detailed specification of
#.      the synchronization semantics.

"When executing a futex operation that requests to block a thread, the kernel "

"comparison of that value with the expected value, and the actual blocking "
"will happen atomically and will be totally ordered with respect to "
"concurrent operations performed by other threads on the same futex word.  "
"Thus, the futex word is used to connect the synchronization in user space "

"One use of futexes is for implementing locks.  The state of the lock (i.e., "
"acquired or not acquired)  can be represented as an atomically accessed flag "
"in shared memory.  In the uncontended case, a thread can access or modify "
"the lock state with atomic instructions, for example atomically changing it "
"from not acquired to acquired using an atomic compare-and-exchange "
"instruction.  (Such instructions are performed entirely in user mode, and "
"the kernel maintains no information about the lock state.)  On the other "
"hand, a thread may be unable to acquire a lock because it is already "
"acquired by another thread.  It then may pass the lock's flag as a futex "
"word and the value representing the acquired state as the expected value to "
"a B<futex>()  wait operation.  This B<futex>()  operation will block if and "
"only if the lock is still acquired (i.e., the value in the futex word still "
"matches the \"acquired state\").  When releasing the lock, a thread has to "
"first reset the lock state to not acquired and then execute a futex "
"operation that wakes threads blocked on the lock flag used as a futex word "
"(this can be further optimized to avoid unnecessary wake-ups).  See "

#.  Darren Hart notes that a patch to allow glibc to fully support
#.  PI-aware pthreads condition variables has not yet been accepted into
#.  glibc. The story is complex, and can be found at
#.  https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11588
#.  Darren notes that in the meantime, the patch is shipped with various
#.  PREEMPT_RT-enabled Linux systems.
#.  Related to the preceding, Darren proposed that somewhere, man-pages
#.  should document the following point:
#.      While the Linux kernel, since 2.6.31, supports requeueing of
#.      priority-inheritance (PI) aware mutexes via the
#.      FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI and FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI futex operations,
#.      the glibc implementation does not yet take full advantage of this.
#.      Specifically, the condvar internal data lock remains a non-PI aware
#.      mutex, regardless of the type of the pthread_mutex associated with
#.      the condvar. This can lead to an unbounded priority inversion on
#.      the internal data lock even when associating a PI aware
#.      pthread_mutex with a condvar during a pthread_cond*_wait
#.      operation. For this reason, it is not recommended to rely on
#.      priority inheritance when using pthread condition variables.
#.  The problem is that the obvious location for this text is
#.  the pthread_cond*wait(3) man page. However, such a man page
#.  does not currently exist.
