"When the build environment is such that a top level B<make> invokes B<sub-"

"I<Makefile> ), no individual instance of B<make> knows how many tasks are "
"running in parallel, so keeping the number of tasks under the upper limit "
"would be impossible without communication between all the B<make> instances "
"running. While solutions like having the top level B<make> serve as a "
"central controller are feasible, or using other synchronization mechanisms "
"like shared memory or sockets can be created, the current implementation "

"This pipe is created by the top-level B<make> process, and passed on to all "

"for itself). Whenever any of the B<make> processes (including the top-level "
"B<make> ) needs to run a new task, it reads a byte from the shared pipe. If "
"there are no tokens left, it must wait for a token to be written back to the "
"pipe. Once the task is completed, the B<make> process writes a token back to "
"the pipe (and thus, if the tokens had been exhausted, unblocking the first "
"B<make> process that was waiting to read a token).  Since only B<N-1> tokens "
"were written into the pipe, no more than B<N> tasks can be running at any "
