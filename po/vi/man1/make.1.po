"B<make> ) needs to run a new task, it reads a byte from the shared pipe. If "
"there are no tokens left, it must wait for a token to be written back to the "
"pipe. Once the task is completed, the B<make> process writes a token back to "
"the pipe (and thus, if the tokens had been exhausted, unblocking the first "
"B<make> process that was waiting to read a token).  Since only B<N-1> tokens "
"were written into the pipe, no more than B<N> tasks can be running at any "
