"This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These "
"options control the behaviour of B<find> but are specified immediately after "
"the last path name.  The five `real' options B<-H>, B<-L>, B<-P>, B<-D> and "
"B<-O> must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash B<--"
"> could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not "
"options, but this does not really work due to the way B<find> determines the "
"end of the following path arguments: it does that by reading until an "
"expression argument comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if a path "
"argument would start with a `-', then B<find> would treat it as expression "
"argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as such, "
"and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded by the calling "
"shell are not mistakenly treated as expression arguments, it is generally "
"safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use "
"absolute path names starting with '/'."
