"B<close>(), the file descriptor is guaranteed to be closed.  However, it "
"also permits another possibility: that the implementation returns an "
"B<EINTR> error and keeps the file descriptor open.  (According to its "
"documentation, HP-UX's B<close>()  does this.)  The caller must then once "
"more use B<close>()  to close the file descriptor, to avoid file descriptor "
"leaks.  This divergence in implementation behaviors provides a difficult "
"hurdle for portable applications, since on many implementations, B<close>()  "
"must not be called again after an B<EINTR> error, and on at least one, "
"B<close>()  must be called again.  There are plans to address this conundrum "
"for the next major release of the POSIX.1 standard."

#.  One such race involves signals and ERESTARTSYS. If a file descriptor
#.  in use by a system call is closed and then reused by e.g. an
#.  independent open() in some unrelated thread, before the original system
#.  call has restarted after ERESTARTSYS, the original system call will
#.  later restart with the reused file descriptor. This is most likely a
#.  serious programming error.
