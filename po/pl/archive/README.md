# Plain text translations archive 

After merging the Polish man pages translations from https://sourceforge.net/projects/manpages-pl/ into the manpages-l10n project, most of the outdated plain text translations have been imported into .po files. 

But in some cases, it was very difficult. For a reasonable import it is needed to know which original text a translation is based on. If we couldn't determine the origin of the translation, we have archived the text file here in the plain/ directory. Maybe it is useful as a compendium for translators.

This archive also contains some .po files in the po/ directory. These translations are now maintained in the appropriate upstream projects and will kept here until the contents have been arrived there. Currently, this applies to the translations from the procps/procps-ng packages.
