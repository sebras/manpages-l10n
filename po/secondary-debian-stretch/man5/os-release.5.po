"source the configuration from shell scripts, however, beyond mere variable "
"assignments, no shell features are supported (this means variable expansion "
"is explicitly not supported), allowing applications to read the file without "
"implementing a shell compatible execution engine\\&. Variable assignment "
"values must be enclosed in double or single quotes if they include spaces, "
"semicolons or other special characters outside of A\\(enZ, a\\(enz, "
"0\\(en9\\&. Shell special characters (\"$\", quotes, backslash, backtick) "
