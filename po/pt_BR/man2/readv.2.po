"To deal with the fact that B<IOV_MAX> was so low on early versions of Linux, "
"the glibc wrapper functions for B<readv>()  and B<writev>()  did some extra "
"work if they detected that the underlying kernel system call failed because "
"this limit was exceeded.  In the case of B<readv>(), the wrapper function "
"allocated a temporary buffer large enough for all of the items specified by "
"I<iov>, passed that buffer in a call to B<read>(2), copied data from the "
"buffer to the locations specified by the I<iov_base> fields of the elements "
"of I<iov>, and then freed the buffer.  The wrapper function for B<writev>()  "
"performed the analogous task using a temporary buffer and a call to "
"B<write>(2)."
