#.  From: Fredrik Noring <noring@nocrew.org>
#.  One such race involves signals and ERESTARTSYS. If a file descriptor
#.  in use by a system call is closed and then reused by e.g. an
#.  independent open() in some unrelated thread, before the original system
#.  call has restarted after ERESTARTSYS, the original system call will
#.  later restart with the reused file descriptor. This is most likely a
#.  serious programming error.
