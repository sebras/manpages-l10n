"B<plocate> finds all files on the system matching the given pattern (or all "

"B<updatedb>(8)."

"plocate is largely compatible with B<mlocate>(1), and reuses its database to "
"create its index, but is significantly faster. In particular, it rarely "
"needs to scan through its entire database, unless the pattern is very short "
"(less than three bytes)  or you want to search for a regular expression. It "
"does not try to maintain compatibility with BSD locate, or non-UTF-8 "
"filenames and locales. Most I/O is done asynchronously, but the results are "
