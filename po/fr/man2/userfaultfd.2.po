"Starting from Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can also notify the fault-handling "
"threads about changes in the virtual memory layout of the faulting process.  "
"In addition, if the faulting process invokes B<fork>(2), the userfaultfd "
"objects associated with the parent may be duplicated into the child process "
"and the userfaultfd monitor will be notified (via the B<UFFD_EVENT_FORK> "
"described below)  about the file descriptor associated with the userfault "
"objects created for the child process, which allows the userfaultfd monitor "
"to perform user-space paging for the child process.  Unlike page faults "
"which have to be synchronous and require an explicit or implicit wakeup, all "
"other events are delivered asynchronously and the non-cooperative process "
"resumes execution as soon as the userfaultfd manager executes B<read>(2).  "
"The userfaultfd manager should carefully synchronize calls to B<UFFDIO_COPY> "

"the faulting process.  With this feature, userfaultfd can be used for "
"robustness purposes to simply catch any access to areas within the "
"registered address range that do not have pages allocated, without having to "
"listen to userfaultfd events.  No userfaultfd monitor will be required for "
"dealing with such memory accesses.  For example, this feature can be useful "
"for applications that want to prevent the kernel from automatically "
"allocating pages and filling holes in sparse files when the hole is accessed "
