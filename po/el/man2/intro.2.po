"Section 2 of the manual describes the Linux system calls.  A system call is "
"an entry point into the Linux kernel.  Usually, system calls are not invoked "
"directly: instead, most system calls have corresponding C library wrapper "
"functions which perform the steps required (e.g., trapping to kernel mode) "
"in order to invoke the system call.  Thus, making a system call looks the "
"same as invoking a normal library function."
