    The translations of manpages are licensed under the
    GNU General Public License version 3, or (at your option)
    any later version. Please see the file LICENSE for
    the complete text of the license.

    These translations have been contributed by many different
    people, see the file AUTHORS for a complete list.

    In order to create a translated manpage from the english
    original manpage, this package will download a Debian
    package which contains the english original manpage and
    afterwards generate the translation.

    Please note that those original manpages are distributed
    under a variety of copyright licenses.  Although these
    licenses permit free distribution of those manpages,
    commercial distribution may impose other requirements
    (e.g., acknowledgement of copyright or inclusion of the
    raw nroff sources with the commercial distribution).

    If you distribute the translated manpages commercially,
    it is your responsibility to figure out your obligations.
    For many manpages, these obligations require you to
    distribute nroff sources with any pre-formatted manpages
    that you provide. Each file that contains nroff source
    for a manpage also contains the author(s) name, email
    address, and copyright notice.
