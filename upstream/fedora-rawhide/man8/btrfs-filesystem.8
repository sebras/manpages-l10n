.TH "BTRFS-FILESYSTEM" "8" "Jun 13, 2022" "5.18" "BTRFS"
.SH NAME
btrfs-filesystem \- command group that primarily does work on the whole filesystems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBbtrfs filesystem\fP <subcommand> <args>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBbtrfs filesystem\fP is used to perform several whole filesystem level tasks,
including all the regular filesystem operations like resizing, space stats,
label setting/getting, and defragmentation. There are other whole filesystem
tasks like scrub or balance that are grouped in separate commands.
.SH SUBCOMMAND
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B df [options] <path>
Show a terse summary information about allocation of block group types of a given
mount point. The original purpose of this command was a debugging helper. The
output needs to be further interpreted and is not suitable for quick overview.
.sp
An example with description:

\fIData\fP, \fISystem\fP and \fIMetadata\fP are separate block group types.
\fIGlobalReserve\fP is an artificial and internal emergency space, see
below.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIsingle\fP \-\- the allocation profile, defined at mkfs time
.IP \(bu 2
\fItotal\fP \-\- sum of space reserved for all allocation profiles of the
given type, ie. all Data/single. Note that it\(aqs not total size of
filesystem.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIused\fP \-\- sum of used space of the above, ie. file extents, metadata blocks
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIGlobalReserve\fP is an artificial and internal emergency space. It is used eg.
when the filesystem is full. Its \fItotal\fP size is dynamic based on the
filesystem size, usually not larger than 512MiB, \fIused\fP may fluctuate.
.sp
The GlobalReserve is a portion of Metadata. In case the filesystem metadata is
exhausted, \fIGlobalReserve/total + Metadata/used = Metadata/total\fP\&. Otherwise
there appears to be some unused space of Metadata.

.TP
.B defragment [options] <file>|<dir> [<file>|<dir>...]
Defragment file data on a mounted filesystem. Requires kernel 2.6.33 and newer.
.sp
If \fI\-r\fP is passed, files in dir will be defragmented recursively (not
descending to subvolumes, mount points and directory symlinks).
The start position and the number of bytes to defragment can be specified by
start and length using \fI\-s\fP and \fI\-l\fP options below.
Extents bigger than value given by \fI\-t\fP will be skipped, otherwise this value
is used as a target extent size, but is only advisory and may not be reached
if the free space is too fragmented.
Use 0 to take the kernel default, which is 256KiB but may change in the future.
You can also turn on compression in defragment operations.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Defragmenting with Linux kernel versions < 3.9 or ≥ 3.14\-rc2 as well as
with Linux stable kernel versions ≥ 3.10.31, ≥ 3.12.12 or ≥ 3.13.4 will break up
the reflinks of COW data (for example files copied with \fBcp \-\-reflink\fP,
snapshots or de\-duplicated data).
This may cause considerable increase of space usage depending on the broken up
reflinks.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Directory arguments without \fI\-r\fP do not defragment files recursively but will
defragment certain internal trees (extent tree and the subvolume tree). This has been
confusing and could be removed in the future.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For \fIstart\fP, \fIlen\fP, \fIsize\fP it is possible to append
units designator: \fIK\fP, \fIM\fP, \fIG\fP, \fIT\fP, \fIP\fP, or \fIE\fP, which represent
KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, or EiB, respectively (case does not matter).
.sp
\fBOptions\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-c[<algo>]
compress file contents while defragmenting. Optional argument selects the compression
algorithm, \fIzlib\fP (default), \fIlzo\fP or \fIzstd\fP\&. Currently it\(aqs not possible to select no
compression. See also section \fIEXAMPLES\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B  \-r
defragment files recursively in given directories, does not descend to
subvolumes or mount points
.TP
.B  \-f
flush data for each file before going to the next file.
.sp
This will limit the amount of dirty data to current file, otherwise the amount
accumulates from several files and will increase system load. This can also lead
to ENOSPC if there\(aqs too much dirty data to write and it\(aqs not possible to make
the reservations for the new data (ie. how the COW design works).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-s <start>[kKmMgGtTpPeE]
defragmentation will start from the given offset, default is beginning of a file
.TP
.B \-l <len>[kKmMgGtTpPeE]
defragment only up to \fIlen\fP bytes, default is the file size
.TP
.B \-t <size>[kKmMgGtTpPeE]
target extent size, do not touch extents bigger than \fIsize\fP, default: 32MiB
.sp
The value is only advisory and the final size of the extents may differ,
depending on the state of the free space and fragmentation or other internal
logic. Reasonable values are from tens to hundreds of megabytes.

.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B  \-v
(deprecated) alias for global \fI\-v\fP option
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B du [options] <path> [<path>..]
Calculate disk usage of the target files using FIEMAP. For individual
files, it will report a count of total bytes, and exclusive (not
shared) bytes. We also calculate a \(aqset shared\(aq value which is
described below.
.sp
Each argument to \fBbtrfs filesystem du\fP will have a \fIset shared\fP value
calculated for it. We define each \fIset\fP as those files found by a
recursive search of an argument (recursion descends to subvolumes but not
mount points). The \fIset shared\fP value then is a sum of all shared space
referenced by the set.
.sp
\fIset shared\fP takes into account overlapping shared extents, hence it
isn\(aqt as simple as adding up shared extents.

is omitted.

.TP
.B resize [options] [<devid>:][+/\-]<size>[kKmMgGtTpPeE]|[<devid>:]max <path>
Resize a mounted filesystem identified by \fIpath\fP\&. A particular device
can be resized by specifying a \fIdevid\fP\&.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If \fIpath\fP is a file containing a BTRFS image then resize does not work
as expected and does not resize the image. This would resize the underlying
filesystem instead.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIdevid\fP can be found in the output of \fBbtrfs filesystem show\fP and
defaults to 1 if not specified.
The \fIsize\fP parameter specifies the new size of the filesystem.
If the prefix \fI+\fP or \fI\-\fP is present the size is increased or decreased
by the quantity \fIsize\fP\&.
If no units are specified, bytes are assumed for \fIsize\fP\&.
Optionally, the size parameter may be suffixed by one of the following
unit designators: \fIK\fP, \fIM\fP, \fIG\fP, \fIT\fP, \fIP\fP, or \fIE\fP, which represent
KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, or EiB, respectively (case does not matter).
.sp
If \fImax\fP is passed, the filesystem will occupy all available space on the
device respecting \fIdevid\fP (remember, devid 1 by default).
.sp
The resize command does not manipulate the size of underlying
partition.  If you wish to enlarge/reduce a filesystem, you must make sure you
can expand the partition before enlarging the filesystem and shrink the
partition after reducing the size of the filesystem.  This can done using
\fBfdisk(8)\fP or \fBparted(8)\fP to delete the existing partition and recreate
it with the new desired size.  When recreating the partition make sure to use
the same starting partition offset as before.
.sp
Growing is usually instant as it only updates the size. However, shrinking could
take a long time if there are data in the device area that\(aqs beyond the new
end. Relocation of the data takes time.

Force a sync of the filesystem at \fIpath\fP, similar to the \fBsync(1)\fP command. In

deletion to complete use the \fBbtrfs subvolume sync\fP command.

\fB$ btrfs filesystem defrag \-v \-r dir/\fP
.sp
Recursively defragment files under \fIdir/\fP, print files as they are processed.
The file names will be printed in batches, similarly the amount of data triggered
by defragmentation will be proportional to last N printed files. The system dirty
memory throttling will slow down the defragmentation but there can still be a lot
of IO load and the system may stall for a moment.
.sp
\fB$ btrfs filesystem defrag \-v \-r \-f dir/\fP

Recursively defragment files under \fIdir/\fP, be verbose and wait until all blocks

.sp
Recursively defragment files under \fIdir/\fP, be verbose and try to merge extents
