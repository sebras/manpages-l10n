.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These configuration files control default parameters for home areas/user accounts created and managed by
\fBsystemd-homed.service\fR(8)\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults\&. Initially, the main configuration file in
/etc/systemd/
contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator\&. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop\-ins, as described below\&. Using drop\-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file\&.
.PP
In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop\-in configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/\&. Those drop\-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file\&. Files in the
*\&.conf\&.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside\&. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files\&.
.PP
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop\-ins under
/usr/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. Drop\-ins have to be used to override package drop\-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\&.
.PP
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are available in the [Home] section:
.PP
\fIDefaultStorage=\fR
.RS 4
The default storage to use for home areas\&. Takes one of
"luks",
"fscrypt",
"directory",
"subvolume",
"cifs"\&. For details about these options, see
\fBhomectl\fR(1)\&. If not configured or assigned the empty string, the default storage is automatically determined: if not running in a container environment and
/home/
is not itself encrypted, defaults to
"luks"\&. Otherwise defaults to
"subvolume"
if
/home/
is on a btrfs file system, and
"directory"
otherwise\&. Note that the storage selected on the
\fBhomectl\fR
command line always takes precedence\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDefaultFileSystemType=\fR
.RS 4
When using
"luks"
as storage (see above), selects the default file system to use inside the user\*(Aqs LUKS volume\&. Takes one of
"btrfs",
"ext4"
or
"xfs"\&. If not specified defaults to
"btrfs"\&. This setting has no effect if a different storage mechanism is used\&. The file system type selected on the
\fBhomectl\fR
command line always takes precedence\&.
