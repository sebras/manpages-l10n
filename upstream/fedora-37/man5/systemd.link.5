.SH "NAME"
systemd.link \- Network device configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fIlink\fR\&.link
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A plain ini\-style text file that encodes configuration for matching network devices, used by
\fBsystemd-udevd\fR(8)
and in particular its
\fBnet_setup_link\fR
builtin\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.PP
The
\&.link
files are read from the files located in the system network directory
/usr/lib/systemd/network
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network, and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. It is recommended that each filename is prefixed with a number (e\&.g\&.
10\-eth0\&.link)\&. Otherwise, the default
\&.link
files or those generated by
\fBsystemd-network-generator.service\fR(8)
may take precedence over user configured files\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority, files in
/run/
take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied link file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.
.PP
Along with the link file
foo\&.link, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.link\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be merged in the alphanumeric order and parsed after the main file itself has been parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main link file wherever located\&.
.PP
The link file contains a [Match] section, which determines if a given link file may be applied to a given device, as well as a [Link] section specifying how the device should be configured\&. The first (in lexical order) of the link files that matches a given device is applied\&. Note that a default file
99\-default\&.link
is shipped by the system\&. Any user\-supplied
\&.link
should hence have a lexically earlier name to be considered at all\&.
.PP
See
\fBudevadm\fR(8)
for diagnosing problems with
\&.link
files\&.
.SH "[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
A link file is said to match an interface if all matches specified by the [Match] section are satisfied\&. When a link file does not contain valid settings in [Match] section, then the file will match all interfaces and
\fBsystemd\-udevd\fR
warns about that\&. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it clear that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
OriginalName=*
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The first (in alphanumeric order) of the link files that matches a given interface is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well\&. The following keys are accepted:
.PP
\fIMACAddress=\fR

.RE
.sp
The total length of each MAC address must be 4 (for IPv4 tunnel), 6 (for Ethernet), 16 (for IPv6 tunnel), or 20 (for InfiniBand)\&. This option may appear more than once, in which case the lists are merged\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior to this is reset\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPermanentMACAddress=\fR
.RS 4
A whitespace\-separated list of hardware\*(Aqs permanent addresses\&. While
\fIMACAddress=\fR
matches the device\*(Aqs current MAC address, this matches the device\*(Aqs permanent MAC address, which may be different from the current one\&. Use full colon\-, hyphen\- or dot\-delimited hexadecimal, or IPv4 or IPv6 address format\&. This option may appear more than once, in which case the lists are merged\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior to this is reset\&. Defaults to unset\&.

\fIID_PATH\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDriver=\fR
.RS 4
A whitespace\-separated list of shell\-style globs matching the driver currently bound to the device, as exposed by the udev property
\fIID_NET_DRIVER\fR
of its parent device, or if that is not set, the driver as exposed by
\fBethtool \-i\fR
of the device itself\&. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIType=\fR
.RS 4
A whitespace\-separated list of shell\-style globs matching the device type, as exposed by
\fBnetworkctl list\fR\&. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted\&. Some valid values are
"ether",
"loopback",
"wlan",
"wwan"\&. Valid types are named either from the udev
"DEVTYPE"
attribute, or
"ARPHRD_"
macros in
linux/if_arp\&.h, so this is not comprehensive\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIKind=\fR
.RS 4
A whitespace\-separated list of shell\-style globs matching the device kind, as exposed by
\fBnetworkctl status \fR\fB\fIINTERFACE\fR\fR
or
\fBip \-d link show \fR\fB\fIINTERFACE\fR\fR\&. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted\&. Some valid values are
"bond",
"bridge",
"gre",
"tun",
"veth"\&. Valid kinds are given by netlink\*(Aqs
"IFLA_INFO_KIND"
attribute, so this is not comprehensive\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIProperty=\fR
.RS 4
A whitespace\-separated list of udev property names with their values after equals sign ("=")\&. If multiple properties are specified, the test results are ANDed\&. If the list is prefixed with a "!", the test is inverted\&. If a value contains white spaces, then please quote whole key and value pair\&. If a value contains quotation, then please escape the quotation with
"\e"\&.
.sp
Example: if a \&.link file has the following:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
Property=ID_MODEL_ID=9999 "ID_VENDOR_FROM_DATABASE=vendor name" "KEY=with \e"quotation\e""
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
then, the \&.link file matches only when an interface has all the above three properties\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIOriginalName=\fR
.RS 4
A whitespace\-separated list of shell\-style globs matching the device name, as exposed by the udev property "INTERFACE"\&. This cannot be used to match on names that have already been changed from userspace\&. Caution is advised when matching on kernel\-assigned names, as they are known to be unstable between reboots\&.

\fIMACAddressPolicy=\fR
.RS 4
The policy by which the MAC address should be set\&. The available policies are:
.PP
\fBpersistent\fR
.RS 4
If the hardware has a persistent MAC address, as most hardware should, and if it is used by the kernel, nothing is done\&. Otherwise, a new MAC address is generated which is guaranteed to be the same on every boot for the given machine and the given device, but which is otherwise random\&. This feature depends on ID_NET_NAME_* properties to exist for the link\&. On hardware where these properties are not set, the generation of a persistent MAC address will fail\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrandom\fR
.RS 4
If the kernel is using a random MAC address, nothing is done\&. Otherwise, a new address is randomly generated each time the device appears, typically at boot\&. Either way, the random address will have the
"unicast"
and
"locally administered"
bits set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnone\fR
.RS 4
Keeps the MAC address assigned by the kernel\&. Or use the MAC address specified in
\fIMACAddress=\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
An empty string assignment is equivalent to setting
"none"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMACAddress=\fR
.RS 4
The interface MAC address to use\&. For this setting to take effect,
\fIMACAddressPolicy=\fR
must either be unset, empty, or
"none"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fINamePolicy=\fR
.RS 4
An ordered, space\-separated list of policies by which the interface name should be set\&.
\fINamePolicy=\fR
may be disabled by specifying
\fBnet\&.ifnames=0\fR
on the kernel command line\&. Each of the policies may fail, and the first successful one is used\&. The name is not set directly, but is exported to udev as the property
\fBID_NET_NAME\fR, which is, by default, used by a
\fBudev\fR(7), rule to set
\fINAME\fR\&. The available policies are:
.PP
\fBkernel\fR
.RS 4
If the kernel claims that the name it has set for a device is predictable, then no renaming is performed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdatabase\fR
.RS 4

\fIID_NET_NAME_FROM_DATABASE\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBonboard\fR
.RS 4
The name is set based on information given by the firmware for on\-board devices, as exported by the udev property

If the device already had a name given by userspace (as part of creation of the device or a rename), keep it\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fIName=\fR
.RS 4
The interface name to use\&. This option has lower precedence than
\fINamePolicy=\fR, so for this setting to take effect,
\fINamePolicy=\fR
must either be unset, empty, disabled, or all policies configured there must fail\&. Also see the example below with
"Name=dmz0"\&.
.sp
Note that specifying a name that the kernel might use for another interface (for example
"eth0") is dangerous because the name assignment done by udev will race with the assignment done by the kernel, and only one interface may use the name\&. Depending on the order of operations, either udev or the kernel will win, making the naming unpredictable\&. It is best to use some different prefix, for example
"internal0"/"external0"
or
"lan0"/"lan1"/"lan3"\&.

"mac"\&. If the kernel does not support the alternative names, then this setting will be ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIAlternativeName=\fR
