.SH NAME

ppmbrighten - replaced by pambrighten

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
Starting with Netpbm 10.86 (March 2019), \fBppmbrighten\fP is
obsolete.  Use
.BR "\fBpambrighten\fP" (1)\c
\& instead.

\fBpambrighten\fP is mostly backward compatible with \fBppmbrighten\fP.  You
can use the \fBpambrighten\fP manual for \fBppmbrighten\fP as long as you
ignore features that were added after Netpbm 10.86.
.PP
One way in which \fBpambrighten\fP is not backward compatible is that
  \fBpambrighten\fP does not have a \fB-normalize\fP option.  If you want
  that function, use \fBpnmnorm\fP on the image before passing it to
  \fBpambrighten\fP.
.PP
Another backward incompatibility is that \fBpambrighten\fP produces the
  same kind of output as the input, whereas \fBppmbrighten\fP always
  produces PPM.  If you need PPM output, pass the results through
  \fBppmtoppm\fP.
.PP
\fBppmbrighten\fP is currently implemented as a triviel program that
  invokes \fBpambrighten\fP, \fBpnmnorm\fP, and \fBppmtoppm\fP.
