.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sgml2html
is an old and obsoleted form of the html converter command
of LinuxDoc-Tools.  It is recommended to switch the new form
.B linuxdoc -B html
now.
This converts a LinuxDoc DTD SGML source file to HTML output.
Output will appear in the top level file
.I file.html
and 
.I file-n.html
for each section, where 
.I file
is the name of the SGML source file and 
.I n
is the section name.
.LP
The attribute/value pair "output=html" is set for conditionals.
