All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may
use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and its
value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamseq\fP generates a PAM image of a specified depth and specified
  maxval that consists of a single row.  The row consists of tuples
  containing sample values in a numerical sequence.
.PP
For example

.nf
\f(CW
    pamseq 1 4
\fP

.fi

  generates a 5 pixel wide image of 1 row with depth 1 tuples containing these
  samples, in order from left to right:

.nf
    0 1 2 3 4

.fi

  The following example uses depth 2:

.nf
\f(CW
    pamseq 2 2
\fP

.fi

  The resulting image is a 9 pixel wide image of 1 row with depth 2 containing
  these samples, in order from left to right;

.nf
    (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,0) (1,2) (1,3) (2,0) (2,1) 2,2)

.fi
.PP
  You can choose the starting and ending sample values and the step for each
  plane:  Here is an example of that:

.nf
\f(CW
    pamseq 1 255 -min=4 -max=8 -step=2
\fP

.fi

This generates

.nf
    4 6 8

.fi

In two dimensions:

.nf
\f(CW
    pamseq 2 255 -min=0,4 -max=2,8 -step=1,2
\fP

.fi

.nf
    (0,4) (0,6) (0,8) (1,4) (1,6) (1,8) (2,4) (2,6) (2,8)

.fi
.PP
  \fBpamseq\fP varies first the highest numbered plane, then the next lower
  numbered plane, etc.  Within each plane, the program varies from low sample
  value to high.

  
.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably \fB-quiet\fP, see 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
 Common Options
.UE
\&), \fBpamseq\fP recognizes the following
command line options:


.TP
\fB-tupletype\fP
This is the value of the "tuple_type" attribute of the created PAM image.
It can be any string up to 255 characters.

.TP
\fB-min=\fP\fIn\fP\fB,\fP\fIn\fP\fB,\fP...
  This gives the starting value for the sequence in each plane.  The number
  of comma-separated numbers must be equal to the number of planes in the
  image (its depth).  Each number must be a whole number no greater than
  the maxval of the image.  The first number is for Plane 0, the second for
  Plane 1, etc.
.sp
The default is 0 in every plane.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.99 (June 2022).

.TP
\fB-max=\fP\fIn\fP\fB,\fP\fIn\fP\fB,\fP...
.sp
This is analogous to \fB-min\fP, giving the ending value for the
    sequence.
.sp
Each value must be at least as great as the corresponding \fB-min\fP
    value.
.sp
The default is the maxval in every plane.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.99 (June 2022).

.TP
\fB-step=\fP\fIn\fP\fB,\fP\fIn\fP\fB,\fP...
.sp
This is analogous to \fB-min\fP, giving the step value for the
    sequence (difference between two consecutive numbers).
.sp
Each value must be positive and no greater than the maxval.
.sp
The default is 1.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.99 (June 2022).



.UN usage
.SH USAGE
.PP
To create a simple ramp of the values 0..255, for input to various matrix
calculations, try
.nf
\f(CW
  pamseq 1 255 
\fP

.fi
(Before \fBpamseq\fP existed, \fBpgmramp\fP was often pressed into service
for this).
.PP
To create a PPM color map of all the possible colors representable with a
maxval of 5, do
.nf
\f(CW
  pamseq 3 5 -tupletype=RGB | pamtopnm
\fP

.fi

Again, with a modern program based on the Netpbm library, you don't need
the \fBpamtopnm\fP because a PAM RGB image is equivalent to a PPM image.
.PP
You can use such a color map with
.BR "pnmremap" (1)\c
\& to quantize the colors in an
image.  With the maxval of 5 given in the example, you get a color map
of the set of "web safe" colors as defined by Netscape.  Most web
browsers guarantee that they can produce at least these 216 colors
(215 plus black).
.PP
\fBpamrestack\fP can often produce a useful two-dimensional image from
\fBpamseq\fP's single row.

.nf
\f(CW
    pamseq 2 255 -min=0,4 -max=2,8 -step=1,2 | pamrestack -width=3
\fP

.fi

.nf
    (0,4) (0,6) (0,8)
    (1,4) (1,6) (1,8)
    (2,4) (2,6) (2,8)

.fi
