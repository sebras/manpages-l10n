.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpnmtoxwd\fP reads a PNM image as input and produces an X11
window dump as output.  You can display this output with \fBxwud\fP.
.PP
Normally, pnmtoxwd produces a StaticGray dump file for PBM and PGM
files.  For PPM, it writes a PseudoColor dump file if there are up to
256 colors in the input, and a DirectColor dump file otherwise.
.PP
In an X11 window dump file, various integers can be represented in
either big endian (most significant byte first) or little endian code.
Those generated by \fBpnmtoxwd\fP are always big endian.
