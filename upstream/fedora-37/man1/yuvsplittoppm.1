This program is part of

\fByuvsplittoppm\fP reads three files, containing the YUV
components, as input.  These files are \fIbasename\fP.Y,
\fIbasename\fP.U, and \fIbasename\fP.V.  Produces a PPM image
on Standard Output.

Since the YUV files are raw files, the dimensions \fIwidth\fP and
\fIheight\fP must be specified on the command line.
