.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtoapplevol\fP

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBppmtoapplevol\fP reads a PPM image as input and produces an Apple
volume label image as output.
.PP
EFI-based Apple systems use a simple image format to provide textual labels
for devices.  This program generates that format.
.PP
The input image must be exactly 12 rows tall and up to 255 columns wide.
  The program fails if it is not.  Use \fBpamfile\fP to see the dimensions of
  your image and \fBpamscale\fP or \fBpamcut\fP to make it 12 rows and less
  than 256 columns if it isn't.
.PP
Netpbm does not have a converter for the other direction.

.UN arguments
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
