.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBpamtopdbimg\fP reads a Netpbm image as input and produced a Palm Pilot
Image Viewer image (and Image record in a PDB file) as output.
.PP
If the Netpbm image is black and white, the Pilot image is monochrome.
Otherwise, the Pilot image is either 4-level or 16-level grayscale, depending
on the \fB-4depth\fP option.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably \fB-quiet\fP, see 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
 Common Options
.UE
\&), \fBpamtopdbimg\fP recognizes the following
command line options:



.TP
\fB-title=\fP\fItext\fP
The title of the image, to be included in the image.

.TP
\fB-compressed\fP
.TP
\fB-uncompressed\fP
.TP
\fB-maybecompressed\fP
You may specify only one of these.
\fB-compressed\fP says to generate the image in compressed format.
\fB-uncompressed\fP says to generate the image in uncompressed format.
\fB-maybecompressed\fP says to generate whichever format is smaller
(the compression algorithm sometimes actually makes the data larger).

.TP
\fB-4depth\fP
This option makes \fBpamtopdbimg\fP create the image in 16-level
grayscale (4 bits per pixel) format.  If you don't specify this,
\fBpamtopdbimg\fP uses 4-level (2 bits per pixel) format.
.sp
This option has no effect when the input is black and white
(maxval 1).  In that case, \fBpamtopdbimg\fP generates the monochrome
(1 bit per pixel) format regardless.

.TP
\fB-notefile=\fP\fIfilename\fP
Attach the note in the specified file to the image.
.sp
If you don't specify this, \fBpamtopdbimg\fP does not attach any note.

.TP
\fB-fixedtime\fP
Fake the mtime and ctime vaues in the PDB image with a value that is the
same every time you run the program.  This facilitates testing and
verification because it means with the same input you always get the
same output.
.sp
This option was new in Netpbm 10.98 (March 2022).

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamtopdbimg\fP was new in Netpbm 10.52 (September 2010).
It was modelled after Eric A. Howe's \fBimgvtopbm\fP package, which
dates back to September 1997.
