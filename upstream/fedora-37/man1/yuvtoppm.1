.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fByuvtoppm\fP reads raw Abekas YUV bytes as input and produces a
PPM image as output.  The input file is just YUV bytes.  You have to
specify the width and height on the command line, since the program
obviously can't get them from the file.  \fByuvotppm\fP assumes the
maxval of the input is 255.
.PP
The
.BR "\fBppmtoyuv\fP manual" (1)\c
\& tells a little
about the Abekas YUV format.
