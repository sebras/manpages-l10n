Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use
double hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name
from its value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
This program converts Netpbm image files into Utah RLE image files.
You can include a transparency mask.  If the input is a multiple image file,
the output consists of several concatenated RLE images.
.PP
\fIpnmfile\fP is the name of the Netpbm image input file.  If you don't
specify this argument, input is from Standard Input.
.PP
The RLE file will contain either a three channel color image (24 bits) or a
single channel grayscale image (8 bits) depending upon the type of Netpbm
input.  If the Netpbm input is color, the RLE output is 3 channel 24 bit
color.  If the Netpbm input is grayscale or black and white, the RLE output is
single channel grayscale.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably \fB-quiet\fP, see 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
 Common Options
.UE
\&), \fBpnmtorle\fP recognizes the following command line options:


.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
  This option will cause \fBpnmtorle\fP to operate in verbose mode.  The
  program writes header information to Standard Error.  Actually, there is not
  much header information stored in a Netpbm file, so this information is
  minimal.
.sp
Before Netpbm 10.98 (March 2022), this option is just \fB-v\fP.

.TP
\fB-header\fP
This option causes the program to dump the header of the Netpbm image to be
Standard Error without converting the file.  It is equivalent to using
the \fB-verbose\fP option except that no file conversion takes place.
.sp
Before Netpbm 10.98 (March 2022), this option is just \fB-h\fP.

.TP
\fB-alpha\fP
This option causes \fBpnmtorle\fP to include a transparency channel in the
output image.  The transparency channel is based on the image: Wherever a
pixel is black, the corresponding trasparency value is transparent.
Everywhere else, the transparency value is fully opaque.

.TP
\fB-outfile\fP \fIoutfile\fP
If you specify this option, \fBpnmtorle\fP writes the output to
this file.  If \fIoutfile\fP is \fB-\fP or you don't specify
\fB-outfile\fP, \fBpnmtorle\fP writes the output to Standard Output.
.sp
Before Netpbm 10.98 (March 2022), this option is just \fB-o\fP.and
    must be separated from its value by a space, not an equal sign.



.UN examples
.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
   pnmtorle -verbose file.ppm -outfile=file.rle

.fi
.PP
While running in verbose mode, convert file.ppm to RLE format and store
resulting data in file.rle.

.nf
   pnmtorle -header file.pgm

.fi
.PP
Dump the header information of the Netpbm file called file.pgm.
