.SH DESCRIPTION

This program is part of

\fBpbmtocis\fP reads a PBM image as input and produces a CompuServe
RLE image as output.

A CompuServe RLE image can be either 128 x 96 pixels or 256 x 192 pixels.
Anything in excess on the right or bottom is cropped.  If width or height
is insufficient, padding is added on the right or bottom.  For better
control of the size adjustment use \fBpamcut\fP or \fBpnmpad\fP.
