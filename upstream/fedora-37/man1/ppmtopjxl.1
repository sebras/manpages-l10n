.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBppmtopjxl\fP reads a PPM image as input and produces a PCL file
suitable for printing on an HP PaintJet XL printer as output.
.PP
The generated file is not suitable for printing on a normal
PrintJet printer.  The \fB-nopack\fP option generates a file which
does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression method and thus might
be printable on a normal PaintJet printer (not an XL).

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably \fB-quiet\fP, see 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
 Common Options
.UE
\&), \fBppmtopjxl\fP recognizes the following
command line options:



.TP
\fB-nopack\fP
.sp
Generate a file which does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression
method. This file might be printable on a normal PaintJet printer
(not an XL).

.TP
\fB-gamma\fP
.sp
Set the gamma correction for the image. The useful range for the
PaintJet XL is approximately 0.6 to 1.5.

.TP
\fB-dither\fP, \fB-cluster\fP, \fB-diffuse\fP
.sp
Alter the rendering algorithm used for images.  These options
select ordered dithering, clustered ordered dithering, or error
diffusion respectively.

.TP
\fB-dark\fP
.sp
Enhance images with a dark background when they are reduced in size.

.TP
\fB-presentation\fP
.sp
Turn on presentation mode, in which two passes are made over the
paper to increase ink density.  You should use this only for images where
quality is critical.

.TP
\fB-xsize\fP, \fB-ysize\fP
.sp
Resize the image.  The parameter to either of these options is
interpreted as the number of dots to set the width or height to, but
you may append an optional dimension of `\fBpt\fP' (points),
`\fBdp\fP' (decipoints), `\fBin\fP' (inches), or `\fBcm\fP'
(centimetres).  If you specify only one dimension, \fBppmtopjxl\fP
will scale the other one appropriately.

.TP
\fB-width\fP, \fB-height\fP
.sp
Synonyms of \fB-xsize\fP and \fB-ysize\fP.

.TP
\fB-xscale\fP, \fB-yscale\fP
.sp
Alternatives to \fB-xsize\fP and \fB-ysize\fP.  Scale the
image by a simple factor.

.TP
\fB-xshift\fP, \fB-yshift\fP
.sp
Shift the image on the page.  These move the image the specified
dimensions right and down.
