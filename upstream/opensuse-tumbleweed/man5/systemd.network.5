.SH "NAME"
systemd.network \- Network configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetwork\fR\&.network
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A plain ini\-style text file that encodes network configuration for matching network interfaces, used by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.PP
The main network file must have the extension
\&.network; other extensions are ignored\&. Networks are applied to links whenever the links appear\&.
.PP
The
\&.network
files are read from the files located in the system network directories
/usr/lib/systemd/network
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. It is recommended that each filename is prefixed with a number (e\&.g\&.
10\-eth0\&.network)\&. Otherwise, the default
\&.network
files or those generated by
\fBsystemd-network-generator.service\fR(8)
may take precedence over user configured files\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority, files in
/run/
take precedence over files with the same name under
/usr/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.
.PP
Along with the network file
foo\&.network, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.network\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be merged in the alphanumeric order and parsed after the main file itself has been parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main network file wherever located\&.
.SH "[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The network file contains a [Match] section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a given interface; and a [Network] section specifying how the interface should be configured\&. The first (in alphanumeric order) of the network files that matches a given interface is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well\&.
.PP
A network file is said to match a network interface if all matches specified by the [Match] section are satisfied\&. When a network file does not contain valid settings in [Match] section, then the file will match all interfaces and
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
warns about that\&. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it clear that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:

.RE
.SH "[LINK] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The [Link] section accepts the following keys:
.PP
\fIMACAddress=\fR
.RS 4
The hardware address to set for the device\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMTUBytes=\fR
.RS 4
The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device\&. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported and are understood to the base of 1024\&.
.sp
Note that if IPv6 is enabled on the interface, and the MTU is chosen below 1280 (the minimum MTU for IPv6) it will automatically be increased to this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIARP=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the ARP (low\-level Address Resolution Protocol) for this interface is enabled\&. When unset, the kernel\*(Aqs default will be used\&.
.sp
For example, disabling ARP is useful when creating multiple MACVLAN or VLAN virtual interfaces atop a single lower\-level physical interface, which will then only serve as a link/"bridge" device aggregating traffic to the same physical link and not participate in the network otherwise\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMulticast=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the multicast flag on the device is enabled\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIAllMulticast=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the driver retrieves all multicast packets from the network\&. This happens when multicast routing is enabled\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPromiscuous=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, promiscuous mode of the interface is enabled\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.sp
If this is set to false for the underlying link of a
"passthru"
mode MACVLAN/MACVTAP, the virtual interface will be created with the
"nopromisc"
flag set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIUnmanaged=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. When
"yes", no attempts are made to bring up or configure matching links, equivalent to when there are no matching network files\&. Defaults to
"no"\&.
.sp
This is useful for preventing later matching network files from interfering with certain interfaces that are fully controlled by other applications\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGroup=\fR
.RS 4
Link groups are similar to port ranges found in managed switches\&. When network interfaces are added to a numbered group, operations on all the interfaces from that group can be performed at once\&. Takes an unsigned integer in the range 0\&...2147483647\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRequiredForOnline=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean or a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state\&. Please see
\fBnetworkctl\fR(1)
for possible operational states\&. When
"yes", the network is deemed required when determining whether the system is online (including when running
\fBsystemd\-networkd\-wait\-online\fR)\&. When
"no", the network is ignored when determining the online state\&. When a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state are set,
"yes"
is implied, and this controls the minimum and maximum operational state required for the network interface to be considered online\&.
.sp
Defaults to
"yes"
when
\fIActivationPolicy=\fR
is not set, or set to
"up",
"always\-up", or
"bound"\&. Defaults to
"no"
when
\fIActivationPolicy=\fR
is set to
"manual"
or
"down"\&. This is forced to
"no"
when
\fIActivationPolicy=\fR
is set to
"always\-down"\&.
.sp
The network will be brought up normally (as configured by
\fIActivationPolicy=\fR), but in the event that there is no address being assigned by DHCP or the cable is not plugged in, the link will simply remain offline and be skipped automatically by
\fBsystemd\-networkd\-wait\-online\fR
if
"RequiredForOnline=no"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRequiredFamilyForOnline=\fR
.RS 4
Takes an address family\&. When specified, an IP address in the given family is deemed required when determining whether the link is online (including when running
\fBsystemd\-networkd\-wait\-online\fR)\&. Takes one of
"ipv4",
"ipv6",
"both", or
"any"\&. Defaults to
"any"\&. Note that this option has no effect if
"RequiredForOnline=no", or if
"RequiredForOnline="
specifies a minimum operational state below
"degraded"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIActivationPolicy=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the policy for
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
managing the link administrative state\&. Specifically, this controls how
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
changes the network device\*(Aqs
"IFF_UP"
flag, which is sometimes controlled by system administrators by running e\&.g\&.,
\fBip link set dev eth0 up\fR
or
\fBip link set dev eth0 down\fR, and can also be changed with
\fBnetworkctl up eth0\fR
or
\fBnetworkctl down eth0\fR\&.
.sp
Takes one of
"up",
"always\-up",
"manual",
"always\-down",
"down", or
"bound"\&. When
"manual",
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
will not change the link\*(Aqs admin state automatically; the system administrator must bring the interface up or down manually, as desired\&. When
"up"
(the default) or
"always\-up", or
"down"
or
"always\-down",
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
will set the link up or down, respectively, when the interface is (re)configured\&. When
"always\-up"
or
"always\-down",
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
will set the link up or down, respectively, any time
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
detects a change in the administrative state\&. When
\fIBindCarrier=\fR
is also set, this is automatically set to
"bound"
and any other value is ignored\&.
.sp
When the policy is set to
"down"
or
"manual", the default value of
\fIRequiredForOnline=\fR
is
"no"\&. When the policy is set to
"always\-down", the value of
\fIRequiredForOnline=\fR
forced to
"no"\&.
.sp
The administrative state is not the same as the carrier state, so using
"always\-up"
does not mean the link will never lose carrier\&. The link carrier depends on both the administrative state as well as the network device\*(Aqs physical connection\&. However, to avoid reconfiguration failures, when using
"always\-up",
\fIIgnoreCarrierLoss=\fR
is forced to true\&.
.RE
.SH "[SR\-IOV] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The [SR\-IOV] section accepts the following keys\&. Specify several [SR\-IOV] sections to configure several SR\-IOVs\&. SR\-IOV provides the ability to partition a single physical PCI resource into virtual PCI functions which can then be injected into a VM\&. In the case of network VFs, SR\-IOV improves north\-south network performance (that is, traffic with endpoints outside the host machine) by allowing traffic to bypass the host machine\(cqs network stack\&.

The domains without the prefix are called "search domains" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single\-label hostnames (hostnames containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)\&. If a single\-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved\&.

Both "search" and "routing\-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look\-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface\&. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi\-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface\&.
