.SH "NAME"
systemd.exec \- Execution environment configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fIservice\fR\&.service,
\fIsocket\fR\&.socket,
\fImount\fR\&.mount,
\fIswap\fR\&.swap
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Unit configuration files for services, sockets, mount points, and swap devices share a subset of configuration options which define the execution environment of spawned processes\&.
.PP
This man page lists the configuration options shared by these four unit types\&. See
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)
for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.swap\fR(5), and
\fBsystemd.mount\fR(5)
for more information on the specific unit configuration files\&. The execution specific configuration options are configured in the [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap] sections, depending on the unit type\&.
.PP
In addition, options which control resources through Linux Control Groups (cgroups) are listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)\&. Those options complement options listed here\&.
.SH "AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES"
.PP
A few execution parameters result in additional, automatic dependencies to be added\&.
.PP
Units with
\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR,
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
or
\fIRootImage=\fR
set automatically gain dependencies of type
\fIRequires=\fR
and
\fIAfter=\fR
on all mount units required to access the specified paths\&. This is equivalent to having them listed explicitly in
\fIRequiresMountsFor=\fR\&.
.PP
Similar, units with
\fIPrivateTmp=\fR
enabled automatically get mount unit dependencies for all mounts required to access
/tmp
and
/var/tmp\&. They will also gain an automatic
\fIAfter=\fR
dependency on
\fBsystemd-tmpfiles-setup.service\fR(8)\&.
.PP
Units whose standard output or error output is connected to
\fBjournal\fR,
\fBsyslog\fR
or
\fBkmsg\fR
(or their combinations with console output, see below) automatically acquire dependencies of type
\fIAfter=\fR
on
systemd\-journald\&.socket\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a directory path relative to the service\*(Aqs root directory specified by
\fIRootDirectory=\fR, or the special value
"~"\&. Sets the working directory for executed processes\&. If set to
"~", the home directory of the user specified in
\fIUser=\fR
is used\&. If not set, defaults to the root directory when systemd is running as a system instance and the respective user\*(Aqs home directory if run as user\&. If the setting is prefixed with the
"\-"
character, a missing working directory is not considered fatal\&. If
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
is not set, then
\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
is relative to the root of the system running the service manager\&. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a directory path relative to the host\*(Aqs root directory (i\&.e\&. the root of the system running the service manager)\&. Sets the root directory for executed processes, with the
\fBchroot\fR(2)
system call\&. If this is used, it must be ensured that the process binary and all its auxiliary files are available in the
\fBchroot()\fR
jail\&. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above)\&.
.sp
The
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR
and
\fIPrivateUsers=\fR
settings are particularly useful in conjunction with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR\&. For details, see below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRootImage=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a path to a block device node or regular file as argument\&. This call is similar to
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
however mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file instead of a directory\&. The device node or file system image file needs to contain a file system without a partition table, or a file system within an MBR/MS\-DOS or GPT partition table with only a single Linux\-compatible partition, or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table that follows the
\m[blue]\fBDiscoverable Partitions Specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. If on, a private mount namespace for the unit\*(Aqs processes is created and the API file systems
/proc,
/sys, and
/dev
are mounted inside of it, unless they are already mounted\&. Note that this option has no effect unless used in conjunction with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
as these three mounts are generally mounted in the host anyway, and unless the root directory is changed, the private mount namespace will be a 1:1 copy of the host\*(Aqs, and include these three mounts\&. Note that the
/dev
file system of the host is bind mounted if this option is used without
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&. To run the service with a private, minimal version of
/dev/, combine this option with
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIUser=\fR, \fIGroup=\fR
.RS 4
Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively\&. Takes a single user or group name, or a numeric ID as argument\&. For system services (services run by the system service manager, i\&.e\&. managed by PID 1) and for user services of the root user (services managed by root\*(Aqs instance of
\fBsystemd \-\-user\fR), the default is
"root", but
\fIUser=\fR
may be used to specify a different user\&. For user services of any other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only valid setting is the same user the user\*(Aqs service manager is running as\&. If no group is set, the default group of the user is used\&. This setting does not affect commands whose command line is prefixed with
"+"\&.
.sp
Note that restrictions on the user/group name syntax are enforced: the specified name must consist only of the characters a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9,
"_"
and
"\-", except for the first character which must be one of a\-z, A\-Z or
"_"
(i\&.e\&. numbers and
"\-"
are not permitted as first character)\&. The user/group name must have at least one character, and at most 31\&. These restrictions are enforced in order to avoid ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux systems\&.
.sp
When used in conjunction with
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
the user/group name specified is dynamically allocated at the time the service is started, and released at the time the service is stopped \(em unless it is already allocated statically (see below)\&. If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is not used the specified user and group must have been created statically in the user database no later than the moment the service is started, for example using the
\fBsysusers.d\fR(5)
facility, which is applied at boot or package install time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean parameter\&. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped\&. The user and group will not be added to
/etc/passwd
or
/etc/group, but are managed transiently during runtime\&. The
\fBnss-systemd\fR(8)
glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system\*(Aqs user and group databases\&. The user and group name to use may be configured via
\fIUser=\fR
and
\fIGroup=\fR
(see above)\&. If these options are not used and dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the unit name\&. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used\&. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated\&. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range 61184\&...65519\&. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users\&. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use\&. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated\&. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories\&. If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is enabled,
\fIRemoveIPC=\fR,
\fIPrivateTmp=\fR
are implied\&. This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group\&. Since
/tmp
and
/var/tmp
are usually the only world\-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination\&. Moreover
\fIProtectSystem=strict\fR
and
\fIProtectHome=read\-only\fR
are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations\&. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be whitelisted using
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn\*(Aqt create security issues involving files created by the service\&. Use
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
(see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated\&. Defaults to off\&.
.RE
.PP
\fISupplementaryGroups=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the supplementary Unix groups the processes are executed as\&. This takes a space\-separated list of group names or IDs\&. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed groups are set as supplementary groups\&. When the empty string is assigned, the list of supplementary groups is reset, and all assignments prior to this one will have no effect\&. In any way, this option does not override, but extends the list of supplementary groups configured in the system group database for the user\&. This does not affect commands prefixed with
"+"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRemoveIPC=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean parameter\&. If set, all System V and POSIX IPC objects owned by the user and group the processes of this unit are run as are removed when the unit is stopped\&. This setting only has an effect if at least one of
\fIUser=\fR,
\fIGroup=\fR
and
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
are used\&. It has no effect on IPC objects owned by the root user\&. Specifically, this removes System V semaphores, as well as System V and POSIX shared memory segments and message queues\&. If multiple units use the same user or group the IPC objects are removed when the last of these units is stopped\&. This setting is implied if
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fINice=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the default nice level (scheduling priority) for executed processes\&. Takes an integer between \-20 (highest priority) and 19 (lowest priority)\&. See
\fBsetpriority\fR(2)
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIOOMScoreAdjust=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the adjustment level for the Out\-Of\-Memory killer for executed processes\&. Takes an integer between \-1000 (to disable OOM killing for this process) and 1000 (to make killing of this process under memory pressure very likely)\&. See
\m[blue]\fBproc\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIOSchedulingClass=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the I/O scheduling class for executed processes\&. Takes an integer between 0 and 3 or one of the strings
\fBnone\fR,
\fBrealtime\fR,
\fBbest\-effort\fR
or
\fBidle\fR\&. See
\fBioprio_set\fR(2)
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIOSchedulingPriority=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the I/O scheduling priority for executed processes\&. Takes an integer between 0 (highest priority) and 7 (lowest priority)\&. The available priorities depend on the selected I/O scheduling class (see above)\&. See
\fBioprio_set\fR(2)
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICPUSchedulingPolicy=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the CPU scheduling policy for executed processes\&. Takes one of
\fBother\fR,
\fBbatch\fR,
\fBidle\fR,
\fBfifo\fR
or
\fBrr\fR\&. See
\fBsched_setscheduler\fR(2)
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICPUSchedulingPriority=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the CPU scheduling priority for executed processes\&. The available priority range depends on the selected CPU scheduling policy (see above)\&. For real\-time scheduling policies an integer between 1 (lowest priority) and 99 (highest priority) can be used\&. See
\fBsched_setscheduler\fR(2)
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICPUSchedulingResetOnFork=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. If true, elevated CPU scheduling priorities and policies will be reset when the executed processes fork, and can hence not leak into child processes\&. See
\fBsched_setscheduler\fR(2)
for details\&. Defaults to false\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICPUAffinity=\fR
.RS 4
Controls the CPU affinity of the executed processes\&. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by either whitespace or commas\&. CPU ranges are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a dash\&. This option may be specified more than once, in which case the specified CPU affinity masks are merged\&. If the empty string is assigned, the mask is reset, all assignments prior to this will have no effect\&. See
\fBsched_setaffinity\fR(2)
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIUMask=\fR
.RS 4
Controls the file mode creation mask\&. Takes an access mode in octal notation\&. See
\fBumask\fR(2)
for details\&. Defaults to 0022\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIEnvironment=\fR
.RS 4
Sets environment variables for executed processes\&. Takes a space\-separated list of variable assignments\&. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be set\&. If the same variable is set twice, the later setting will override the earlier setting\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables is reset, all prior assignments have no effect\&. Variable expansion is not performed inside the strings, however, specifier expansion is possible\&. The $ character has no special meaning\&. If you need to assign a value containing spaces or the equals sign to a variable, use double quotes (") for the assignment\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Environment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=$word 5 6"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
gives three variables
"VAR1",
"VAR2",
"VAR3"
with the values
"word1 word2",
"word3",
"$word 5 6"\&.
.sp
See
\fBenviron\fR(7)
for details about environment variables\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIEnvironmentFile=\fR
.RS 4
Similar to
\fIEnvironment=\fR
but reads the environment variables from a text file\&. The text file should contain new\-line\-separated variable assignments\&. Empty lines, lines without an
"="
separator, or lines starting with ; or # will be ignored, which may be used for commenting\&. A line ending with a backslash will be concatenated with the following one, allowing multiline variable definitions\&. The parser strips leading and trailing whitespace from the values of assignments, unless you use double quotes (")\&.
.sp
The argument passed should be an absolute filename or wildcard expression, optionally prefixed with
"\-", which indicates that if the file does not exist, it will not be read and no error or warning message is logged\&. This option may be specified more than once in which case all specified files are read\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of file to read is reset, all prior assignments have no effect\&.
.sp
The files listed with this directive will be read shortly before the process is executed (more specifically, after all processes from a previous unit state terminated\&. This means you can generate these files in one unit state, and read it with this option in the next)\&.
.sp
Settings from these files override settings made with
\fIEnvironment=\fR\&. If the same variable is set twice from these files, the files will be read in the order they are specified and the later setting will override the earlier setting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPassEnvironment=\fR
.RS 4
Pass environment variables from the systemd system manager to executed processes\&. Takes a space\-separated list of variable names\&. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be set\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables is reset, all prior assignments have no effect\&. Variables that are not set in the system manager will not be passed and will be silently ignored\&.
.sp
Variables passed from this setting are overridden by those passed from
\fIEnvironment=\fR
or
\fIEnvironmentFile=\fR\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
PassEnvironment=VAR1 VAR2 VAR3
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
passes three variables
"VAR1",
"VAR2",
"VAR3"
with the values set for those variables in PID1\&.
.sp
See
\fBenviron\fR(7)
for details about environment variables\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIStandardInput=\fR
.RS 4
Controls where file descriptor 0 (STDIN) of the executed processes is connected to\&. Takes one of
\fBnull\fR,
\fBtty\fR,
\fBtty\-force\fR,
\fBtty\-fail\fR,
\fBsocket\fR
or
\fBfd\fR\&.
.sp
If
\fBnull\fR
is selected, standard input will be connected to
/dev/null, i\&.e\&. all read attempts by the process will result in immediate EOF\&.
.sp
If
\fBtty\fR
is selected, standard input is connected to a TTY (as configured by
\fITTYPath=\fR, see below) and the executed process becomes the controlling process of the terminal\&. If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed process waits until the current controlling process releases the terminal\&.
.sp
\fBtty\-force\fR
is similar to
\fBtty\fR, but the executed process is forcefully and immediately made the controlling process of the terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes from the terminal\&.
.sp
\fBtty\-fail\fR
is similar to
\fBtty\fR
but if the terminal already has a controlling process start\-up of the executed process fails\&.
.sp
The
\fBsocket\fR
option is only valid in socket\-activated services, and only when the socket configuration file (see
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5)
for details) specifies a single socket only\&. If this option is set, standard input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use with the traditional
\fBinetd\fR(8)
daemon\&.
.sp
The
\fBfd\fR
option connects the input stream to a single file descriptor provided by a socket unit\&. A custom named file descriptor can be specified as part of this option, after a
":"
(e\&.g\&.
"fd:\fIfoobar\fR")\&. If no name is specified,
"stdin"
is assumed (i\&.e\&.
"fd"
is equivalent to
"fd:stdin")\&. At least one socket unit defining such name must be explicitly provided via the
\fISockets=\fR
option, and file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit\&. If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used\&. See
\fIFileDescriptorName=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5)
for more details about named descriptors and ordering\&.
.sp
This setting defaults to
\fBnull\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIStandardOutput=\fR
.RS 4
Controls where file descriptor 1 (STDOUT) of the executed processes is connected to\&. Takes one of
\fBinherit\fR,
\fBnull\fR,
\fBtty\fR,
\fBjournal\fR,
\fBsyslog\fR,
\fBkmsg\fR,
\fBjournal+console\fR,
\fBsyslog+console\fR,
\fBkmsg+console\fR,
\fBsocket\fR
or
\fBfd\fR\&.
.sp
\fBinherit\fR
duplicates the file descriptor of standard input for standard output\&.
.sp
\fBnull\fR
connects standard output to
/dev/null, i\&.e\&. everything written to it will be lost\&.
.sp
\fBtty\fR
connects standard output to a tty (as configured via
\fITTYPath=\fR, see below)\&. If the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal\&.
.sp
\fBjournal\fR
connects standard output with the journal which is accessible via
\fBjournalctl\fR(1)\&. Note that everything that is written to syslog or kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific two options listed below are hence supersets of this one\&.
.sp
\fBsyslog\fR
connects standard output to the
\fBsyslog\fR(3)
system syslog service, in addition to the journal\&. Note that the journal daemon is usually configured to forward everything it receives to syslog anyway, in which case this option is no different from
\fBjournal\fR\&.
.sp
\fBkmsg\fR
connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via
\fBdmesg\fR(1), in addition to the journal\&. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this option is no different from
\fBjournal\fR\&.
.sp
\fBjournal+console\fR,
\fBsyslog+console\fR
and
\fBkmsg+console\fR
work in a similar way as the three options above but copy the output to the system console as well\&.
.sp
\fBsocket\fR
connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation\&. The semantics are similar to the same option of
\fIStandardInput=\fR\&.
.sp
The
\fBfd\fR
option connects the output stream to a single file descriptor provided by a socket unit\&. A custom named file descriptor can be specified as part of this option, after a
":"
(e\&.g\&.
"fd:\fIfoobar\fR")\&. If no name is specified,
"stdout"
is assumed (i\&.e\&.
"fd"
is equivalent to
"fd:stdout")\&. At least one socket unit defining such name must be explicitly provided via the
\fISockets=\fR
option, and file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit\&. If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used\&. See
\fIFileDescriptorName=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5)
for more details about named descriptors and ordering\&.
.sp
If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal, syslog or the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type
\fIAfter=\fR
on
systemd\-journald\&.socket
(also see the automatic dependencies section above)\&.
.sp
This setting defaults to the value set with
\fBDefaultStandardOutput=\fR
in
\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5), which defaults to
\fBjournal\fR\&. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIStandardError=\fR
.RS 4
Controls where file descriptor 2 (STDERR) of the executed processes is connected to\&. The available options are identical to those of
\fIStandardOutput=\fR, with some exceptions: if set to
\fBinherit\fR
the file descriptor used for standard output is duplicated for standard error, while
\fBfd\fR
operates on the error stream and will look by default for a descriptor named
"stderr"\&.
.sp
This setting defaults to the value set with
\fBDefaultStandardError=\fR

\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5), which defaults to
\fBinherit\fR\&. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above)\&.

Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes\&. See
\fBsetrlimit\fR(2)
for details on the resource limit concept\&. Resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon\-separated pair
\fBsoft:hard\fR
to set both limits individually (e\&.g\&.
"LimitAS=4G:16G")\&. Use the string
\fIinfinity\fR
to configure no limit on a specific resource\&. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e\&.g\&. LimitAS=16G)\&. For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see
\fBsystemd.time\fR(7)
for details)\&. Note that if no time unit is specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
the default unit of seconds is implied, while for
\fILimitRTTIME=\fR
the default unit of microseconds is implied\&. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement\&. For example, time limits specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s\&. For
\fILimitNICE=\fR
the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with
"+"
or
"\-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range \-20\&.\&.19\&. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0\&.\&.40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1)\&.
.sp
Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per\-process, and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set\&. Also note that
\fILimitRSS=\fR
is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect\&. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)
over these per\-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive\&. For example,
\fIMemoryLimit=\fR
is a more powerful (and working) replacement for
\fILimitRSS=\fR\&.
.sp
For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely\&. For user units however (i\&.e\&. units run by a per\-user instance of
\fBsystemd\fR(1)), these limits are bound by (possibly more restrictive) per\-user limits enforced by the OS\&.

\fINoNewPrivileges=yes\fR

Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86\-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option\&. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with

.sp
Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service invocation\&. Specifically, access to the
\fBexecve\fR
system call is required for the execution of the service binary \(em if it is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail\&. Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly\&. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such failures\&.
.sp
If you specify both types of this option (i\&.e\&. whitelisting and blacklisting), the first encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call)\&. Then the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed system calls from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default action\&. (For example, if you have started with a whitelisting of

This is an effective way to disable compatibility with non\-native architectures for processes, for example to prohibit execution of 32\-bit x86 binaries on 64\-bit x86\-64 systems\&. The special
\fBnative\fR
identifier implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more strictly: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for)\&. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the
\fBCAP_SYS_ADMIN\fR

Note that system call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures\&. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket\-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations \(em a limitation that x86\-64 does not have, however\&. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time \(em such as x86/x86\-64 \(em it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system\&.

Note: the process may be also terminated by a signal not sent by systemd\&. In particular the process may send an arbitrary signal to itself in a handler for any of the non\-maskable signals\&. Nevertheless, in the "timeout" and "watchdog" rows above only the signals that systemd sends have been included\&.

Additional variables may be configured by the following means: for processes spawned in specific units, use the
\fIEnvironment=\fR,
\fIEnvironmentFile=\fR
and
\fIPassEnvironment=\fR
options above; to specify variables globally, use
\fIDefaultEnvironment=\fR
(see
\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5)) or the kernel option
\fIsystemd\&.setenv=\fR
(see
\fBsystemd\fR(1))\&. Additional variables may also be set through PAM, cf\&.\ \&\fBpam_env\fR(8)\&.
