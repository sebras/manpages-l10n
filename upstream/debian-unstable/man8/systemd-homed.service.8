.SH "NAME"
systemd-homed.service, systemd-homed \- Home Area/User Account Manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
systemd\-homed\&.service
.PP
/lib/systemd/systemd\-homed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemd\-homed\fR
is a system service that may be used to create, remove, change or inspect home areas (directories and network mounts and real or loopback block devices with a filesystem, optionally encrypted)\&.
.PP
Most of
\fBsystemd\-homed\fR\*(Aqs functionality is accessible through the
\fBhomectl\fR(1)
command\&.
.PP
See the
\m[blue]\fBHome Directories\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
documentation for details about the format and design of home areas managed by
systemd\-homed\&.service\&.
.PP
Each home directory managed by
systemd\-homed\&.service
synthesizes a local user and group\&. These are made available to the system using the
\m[blue]\fBUser/Group Record Lookup API via Varlink\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2, and thus may be browsed with
\fBuserdbctl\fR(1)\&.
.SH "KEY MANAGEMENT"
.PP
User records are cryptographically signed with a public/private key pair (the signature is part of the JSON record itself)\&. For a user to be permitted to log in locally the public key matching the signature of their user record must be installed\&. For a user record to be modified locally the private key matching the signature must be installed locally, too\&. The keys are stored in the
/var/lib/systemd/home/
directory:
.PP
/var/lib/systemd/home/local\&.private
.RS 4
The private key of the public/private key pair used for local records\&. Currently, only a single such key may be installed\&.
.RE
.PP
/var/lib/systemd/home/local\&.public
.RS 4
The public key of the public/private key pair used for local records\&. Currently, only a single such key may be installed\&.
.RE
.PP
/var/lib/systemd/home/*\&.public
.RS 4
Additional public keys\&. Any users whose user records are signed with any of these keys are permitted to log in locally\&. An arbitrary number of keys may be installed this way\&.
.RE
.PP
All key files listed above are in PEM format\&.
.PP
In order to migrate a home directory from a host
"foobar"
to another host
"quux"
it is hence sufficient to copy
/var/lib/systemd/home/local\&.public
from the host
"foobar"
to
"quux", maybe calling the file on the destination
/var/lib/systemd/home/foobar\&.public, reflecting the origin of the key\&. If the user record should be modifiable on
"quux"
the pair
/var/lib/systemd/home/local\&.public
and
/var/lib/systemd/home/local\&.private
need to be copied from
"foobar"
to
"quux", and placed under the identical paths there, as currently only a single private key is supported per host\&. Note of course that the latter means that user records generated/signed before the key pair is copied in, lose their validity\&.
