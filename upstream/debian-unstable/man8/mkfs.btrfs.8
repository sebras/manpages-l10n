.SH NAME
mkfs.btrfs \- create a btrfs filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmkfs.btrfs\fP [options] <device> [<device>...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmkfs.btrfs\fP is used to create the btrfs filesystem on a single or multiple
devices.  The \fIdevice\fP is typically a block device but can be a file\-backed image
as well. Multiple devices are grouped by UUID of the filesystem.
.sp
Before mounting such filesystem, the kernel module must know all the devices
either via preceding execution of \fBbtrfs device scan\fP or using the \fIdevice\fP
mount option. See section \fIMULTIPLE DEVICES\fP for more details.
.sp
The default block group profiles for data and metadata depend on number of
devices and possibly other factors. It\(aqs recommended to use specific profiles
but the defaults should be OK and allowing future conversions to other profiles.
Please see options \fI\-d\fP and \fI\-m\fP for further details and \fBbtrfs\-balance(8)\fP for
the profile conversion post mkfs.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b|\-\-byte\-count <size>
Specify the size of the filesystem. If this option is not used, then
mkfs.btrfs uses the entire device space for the filesystem.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-csum \ <type>\fR,\fB \ \-\-checksum \ <type>
Specify the checksum algorithm. Default is \fIcrc32c\fP\&. Valid values are \fIcrc32c\fP,
\fIxxhash\fP, \fIsha256\fP or \fIblake2\fP\&. To mount such filesystem kernel must support the
checksums as well. See \fICHECKSUM ALGORITHMS\fP in \fBbtrfs(5)\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d|\-\-data <profile>
Specify the profile for the data block groups.  Valid values are \fIraid0\fP,
\fIraid1\fP, \fIraid1c3\fP, \fIraid1c4\fP, \fIraid5\fP, \fIraid6\fP, \fIraid10\fP or \fIsingle\fP or \fIdup\fP
(case does not matter).
.sp
See \fIDUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE\fP for more details.
.sp
On multiple devices, the default was \fIraid0\fP until version 5.7, while it is
\fIsingle\fP since version 5.8. You can still select \fIraid0\fP manually, but it was not
suitable as default.
.TP
.B \-m|\-\-metadata <profile>
Specify the profile for the metadata block groups.
Valid values are \fIraid0\fP, \fIraid1\fP, \fIraid1c3\fP, \fIraid1c4\fP, \fIraid5\fP, \fIraid6\fP,
\fIraid10\fP, \fIsingle\fP or \fIdup\fP (case does not matter).
.sp
Default on a single device filesystem is \fIDUP\fP and is recommended for metadata
in general. The duplication might not be necessary in some use cases and it\(aqs
up to the user to changed that at mkfs time or later. This depends on hardware
that could potentially deduplicate the blocks again but this cannot be detected
at mkfs time.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Up to version 5.14 there was a detection of a SSD device (more precisely
if it\(aqs a rotational device, determined by the contents of file
\fI/sys/block/DEV/queue/rotational\fP) that used to select \fIsingle\fP\&. This has
changed in version 5.15 to be always \fIdup\fP\&.
.sp
Note that the rotational status can be arbitrarily set by the underlying block
device driver and may not reflect the true status (network block device, memory\-backed
SCSI devices, real block device behind some additional device mapper layer,
etc). It\(aqs recommended to always set the options \fI\-\-data/\-\-metadata\fP to avoid
confusion and unexpected results.
.sp
See \fIDUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE\fP for more details.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
On multiple devices the default is \fIraid1\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-M|\-\-mixed
Normally the data and metadata block groups are isolated. The \fImixed\fP mode
will remove the isolation and store both types in the same block group type.
This helps to utilize the free space regardless of the purpose and is suitable
for small devices. The separate allocation of block groups leads to a situation
where the space is reserved for the other block group type, is not available for
allocation and can lead to ENOSPC state.
.sp
The recommended size for the mixed mode is for filesystems less than 1GiB. The
soft recommendation is to use it for filesystems smaller than 5GiB. The mixed
mode may lead to degraded performance on larger filesystems, but is otherwise
usable, even on multiple devices.
.sp
The \fInodesize\fP and \fIsectorsize\fP must be equal, and the block group types must
match.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Versions up to 4.2.x forced the mixed mode for devices smaller than 1GiB.
This has been removed in 4.3+ as it caused some usability issues.
.sp
Mixed profile cannot be used together with other profiles. It can only
be set at creation time. Conversion to or from mixed profile is not
implemented.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-l|\-\-leafsize <size>
Alias for \fI\-\-nodesize\fP\&. Deprecated.
.TP
.B \-n|\-\-nodesize <size>
Specify the nodesize, the tree block size in which btrfs stores metadata. The
default value is 16KiB (16384) or the page size, whichever is bigger. Must be a
multiple of the sectorsize and a power of 2, but not larger than 64KiB (65536).
Leafsize always equals nodesize and the options are aliases.
.sp
Smaller node size increases fragmentation but leads to taller b\-trees which in
turn leads to lower locking contention. Higher node sizes give better packing
and less fragmentation at the cost of more expensive memory operations while
updating the metadata blocks.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Versions up to 3.11 set the nodesize to 4KiB.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-s|\-\-sectorsize <size>
Specify the sectorsize, the minimum data block allocation unit.
.sp
The default value is the page size and is autodetected. If the sectorsize
differs from the page size, the created filesystem may not be mountable by the
running kernel. Therefore it is not recommended to use this option unless you
are going to mount it on a system with the appropriate page size.
.TP
.B \-L|\-\-label <string>
Specify a label for the filesystem. The \fIstring\fP should be less than 256
bytes and must not contain newline characters.
.TP
.B \-K|\-\-nodiscard
Do not perform whole device TRIM operation on devices that are capable of that.
This does not affect discard/trim operation when the filesystem is mounted.
Please see the mount option \fIdiscard\fP for that in \fBbtrfs(5)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-r|\-\-rootdir <rootdir>
Populate the toplevel subvolume with files from \fIrootdir\fP\&.  This does not
require root permissions to write the new files or to mount the filesystem.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
This option may enlarge the image or file to ensure it\(aqs big enough to
contain the files from \fIrootdir\fP\&. Since version 4.14.1 the filesystem size is
not minimized. Please see option \fI\-\-shrink\fP if you need that functionality.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B  \-\-shrink
Shrink the filesystem to its minimal size, only works with \fI\-\-rootdir\fP option.
.sp
If the destination block device is a regular file, this option will also
truncate the file to the minimal size. Otherwise it will reduce the filesystem
available space.  Extra space will not be usable unless the filesystem is
mounted and resized using \fBbtrfs filesystem resize\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0

Prior to version 4.14.1, the shrinking was done automatically.

.B \-f|\-\-force
Forcibly overwrite the block devices when an existing filesystem is detected.
By default, \fBmkfs.btrfs\fP will utilize \fIlibblkid\fP to check for any known
filesystem on the devices. Alternatively you can use the \fBwipefs\fP utility
to clear the devices.
.TP
.B \-q|\-\-quiet
Print only error or warning messages. Options \fI\-\-features\fP or \fI\-\-help\fP are unaffected.
Resets any previous effects of \fI\-\-verbose\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-U|\-\-uuid <UUID>
Create the filesystem with the given \fIUUID\fP\&. The UUID must not exist on any
filesystem currently present.

.SH SIZE UNITS
.sp
The default unit is \fIbyte\fP\&. All size parameters accept suffixes in the 1024
base. The recognized suffixes are: \fIk\fP, \fIm\fP, \fIg\fP, \fIt\fP, \fIp\fP, \fIe\fP, both uppercase
and lowercase.
.SH MULTIPLE DEVICES
.sp
Before mounting a multiple device filesystem, the kernel module must know the
association of the block devices that are attached to the filesystem UUID.
.sp
There is typically no action needed from the user.  On a system that utilizes a
udev\-like daemon, any new block device is automatically registered. The rules
call \fBbtrfs device scan\fP\&.
.sp
The same command can be used to trigger the device scanning if the btrfs kernel
module is reloaded (naturally all previous information about the device
registration is lost).
.sp
Another possibility is to use the mount options \fIdevice\fP to specify the list of
devices to scan at the time of mount.

This means only scanning, if the devices do not exist in the system,
mount will fail anyway. This can happen on systems without initramfs/initrd and
root partition created with RAID1/10/5/6 profiles. The mount action can happen
before all block devices are discovered. The waiting is usually done on the
initramfs/initrd systems.

.SH DUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE
.sp
The mkfs utility will let the user create a filesystem with profiles that write
the logical blocks to 2 physical locations. Whether there are really 2
physical copies highly depends on the underlying device type.
.sp
For example, a SSD drive can remap the blocks internally to a single copy\-\-thus
deduplicating them. This negates the purpose of increased redundancy and just
wastes filesystem space without providing the expected level of redundancy.
.sp
The duplicated data/metadata may still be useful to statistically improve the
chances on a device that might perform some internal optimizations. The actual
details are not usually disclosed by vendors. For example we could expect that
not all blocks get deduplicated. This will provide a non\-zero probability of
recovery compared to a zero chance if the single profile is used. The user
should make the tradeoff decision. The deduplication in SSDs is thought to be
widely available so the reason behind the mkfs default is to not give a false
sense of redundancy.
.sp
As another example, the widely used USB flash or SD cards use a translation
layer between the logical and physical view of the device. The data lifetime
may be affected by frequent plugging. The memory cells could get damaged,
hopefully not destroying both copies of particular data in case of DUP.
.sp
The wear levelling techniques can also lead to reduced redundancy, even if the
device does not do any deduplication. The controllers may put data written in
a short timespan into the same physical storage unit (cell, block etc). In case
this unit dies, both copies are lost. BTRFS does not add any artificial delay
between metadata writes.
.sp
The traditional rotational hard drives usually fail at the sector level.
.sp
In any case, a device that starts to misbehave and repairs from the DUP copy
should be replaced! \fBDUP is not backup\fP\&.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.sp
\fBSMALL FILESYSTEMS AND LARGE NODESIZE\fP
.sp
The combination of small filesystem size and large nodesize is not recommended
in general and can lead to various ENOSPC\-related issues during mount time or runtime.

Since mixed block group creation is optional, we allow small
filesystem instances with differing values for \fIsectorsize\fP and \fInodesize\fP
to be created and could end up in the following situation:

The ENOSPC occurs during the creation of the UUID tree. This is caused
by large metadata blocks and space reservation strategy that allocates more
