.SH NAME
.PP
rpm2archive - Create tar archive from RPM Package Manager (RPM) package.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]rpm2archive\f[R] \f[B]{-n|--nocompression}\f[R] \f[I]FILES\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]rpm2archive\f[R] converts the .rpm files specified as arguments to
tar files.
By default they are gzip compressed and saved with postfix
\[dq].tgz\[dq].
.PP
If \[aq]-\[aq] is given as argument, an rpm stream is read from standard
in and written to standard out.
.PP
In opposite to \f[B]rpm2cpio\f[R] \f[B]rpm2archive\f[R] also works with
RPM packages containing files greater than 4GB which are not supported
by cpio.
Unless \f[B]rpm2cpio\f[R] \f[B]rpm2archive\f[R] needs a working rpm
installation which limits its usefulness for some disaster recovery
scenarios.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-n, --nocompression\f[R]
Generate uncompressed tar archive and use \[dq].tar\[dq] as postfix of
the file name.
