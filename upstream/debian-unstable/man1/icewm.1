\& icewm \- lightweight X11 window manager
.Ve
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBicewm\fR [\fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBicewm\fR is a window manager for the X11 window system.
It aims to be small, fast and familiar to new users.
.PP
\&\fBicewm\fR is called a re-parenting window manager,
because it draws small frames around application windows.
By dragging this frame with the mouse, windows are resized or moved.
.PP
Because windows may overlap, \fBicewm\fR is also a stacking window manager.
Many windows may exist, some hidden behind others.
.PP
\&\fBicewm\fR supports a configurable number of virtual desktops.  These are
called workspaces. Related windows are grouped on a dedicated workspace.
By switching between workspaces, the user can attend to different tasks,
while keeping oversight.  This is supported by a task bar and a pager.
.PP
The installation comes with several themes. Choose a theme via a menu.
.PP
\&\fBicewm\fR is compliant with the \s-1ICCCM\s0 and \s-1EWMH\s0 window manager specifications.
.SS "\s-1PROGRAMS\s0"
.IX Subsection "PROGRAMS"
The \fBicewm\fR package includes several programs:
.IP "\fBicewm\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icewm"
The actual window manager. It positions application windows on screen
and decorates them with borders. It gives input focus to the current
active application. \fBicewm\fR supports different focus modes, which are
explained below. It draws a small task bar at the bottom of the screen,
which gives easy access to programs, to virtual desktops, to active
applications, and to a small set of monitoring applets.
.IP "\fBicewmbg\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icewmbg"
The background setting application. It can assign plain background color
or images in different formats to the X background.  Each workspace can
have its own background.  It supports semi-transparency. Semitransparent
background image and colour can be configured. When the background image
has changed then \fBicewmbg\fR\|(1) can be notified to update the background.
Multi-head monitor setups are fully supported.  See the \fBicewmbg\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fBicewm\-session\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icewm-session"
\&\fBicewm\-session\fR\|(1) is the preferred program to start the IceWM system.
It first loads additional environment variables from the optional
\&\fIenv\fR file. Then it starts \fBicewmbg\fR\|(1) and \fBicewm\fR. It also runs
the \fIstartup\fR script and implements basic session management.
On termination the \fIshutdown\fR script will be run first, then
\&\fBicewm\-session\fR\|(1) will terminate \fBicewm\fR and \fBicewmbg\fR\|(1).
\&\fBicewm\-session\fR\|(1) will also start the optional \fBicesound\fR\|(1)
if you give it the \fB\-\-sound\fR option.  See \fBicewm\-session\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fBicesh\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icesh"
A powerful tool to control window properties and to interact with the
window manager. It is typically used in shell scripts. See \fBicesh\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fBicehelp\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icehelp"
A small document browser, which is used by \fBicewm\fR to display the
\&'IceWM manual' and some man pages.
.IP "\fBicewmhint\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icewmhint"
A utility for passing IceWM-specific window options to \fBicewm\fR.
The options are used to configure the first application which is started
subsequently.  See \fBicewmhint\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fBicesound\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icesound"
Plays audio files on \s-1GUI\s0 events which are raised by \fBicewm\fR.
It supports \s-1ALSA, AO\s0 and \s-1OSS.\s0  See the \fBicesound\fR\|(1) man page.
.IP "\fBicewm\-menu\-fdo\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icewm-menu-fdo"
Generate an \fBicewm\fR menu with executable desktop applications
according to \s-1XDG\s0 specifications. See the \fBicewm\-menu\-fdo\fR\|(1) man page.
.IP "\fBicewm\-set\-gnomewm\fR\|(1)" 4
.IX Item "icewm-set-gnomewm"
Configures \s-1GNOME\s0 to start IceWM instead of its own \s-1WM.\s0
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.SS "\s-1COMMON OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "COMMON OPTIONS"
Each of the IceWM executables supports the following options:
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR=\fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --config=FILE"
Use \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR as the source of configuration options.  By default \fBicewm\fR
looks for a file named \fIpreferences\fR.  This is a readable text file
which can be modified with the help of a text editor.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-theme\fR=\fI\s-1NAME\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t, --theme=NAME"
Use \fI\s-1NAME\s0\fR as the name of the \fBicewm\fR theme to use.  A theme defines
the look and feel of \fBicewm\fR, like colors, fonts and buttons.
.IP "\fB\-\-display\fR=\fI\s-1DISPLAY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--display=DISPLAY"
\&\fI\s-1DISPLAY\s0\fR specifies the connection to the X11 server.  By default
the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DISPLAY\*(C'\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-sync\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sync"
This option specifies to use a slower synchronous communication mode
with the X11 server.  This is irrelevant for normal use.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Gives a complete list of all the available command-line options with
some very brief explanation.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Shows the software release version for this program.
.SS "\s-1ICEWM OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "ICEWM OPTIONS"
The \fBicewm\fR program supports some additional options:
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alpha\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --alpha"
Use a 32\-bit visual for translucency. This can also be set in
the preferences file as \f(CW\*(C`Alpha=1\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-replace\fR" 4
.IX Item "--replace"
Instructs \fBicewm\fR to replace an existing window manager.  Provided that
the window manager being replaced is \s-1ICCCM 2.0\s0 compliant, once it
notices that it is to be replaced it will cease operations and typically
stop execution.  This allows \fBicewm\fR to establish itself as the only
active window manager.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restart\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --restart"
Tell \fBicewm\fR to restart itself. This reloads the configuration from file.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-splash\fR=\fI\s-1IMAGE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --splash=IMAGE"
Briefly show \fI\s-1IMAGE\s0\fR on startup in the center of the screen.
This can also be set in the preferences file as Splash=\f(CW\*(C`image.jpg\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-configured\fR" 4
.IX Item "--configured"
Shows a list of configuration options which were enabled when \fBicewm\fR
was compiled from source code.  This can be helpful if one suspects some
functionality may be missing.
.IP "\fB\-\-directories\fR" 4
.IX Item "--directories"
Gives a list of directories where \fBicewm\fR will look for configuration
data.  This list is printed in the actual order in which \fBicewm\fR uses
it to search for configuration files.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-themes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --list-themes"
\&\fBicewm\fR will search all the configuration directories for theme files
and print a list of all found themes.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-postpreferences\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, --postpreferences"
This gives a long list of all the internal \fBicewm\fR options with their
actual values after \fBicewm\fR has processed all of the configuration and
theme files. In some advanced scenarios this can be helpful to inspect
which configuration was chosen or whether option formatting was correct.
.IP "\fB\-\-rewrite\-preferences\fR" 4
.IX Item "--rewrite-preferences"
Overwrite an existing preferences file with an icewm default preferences,
but preserve all modifications insofar they deviate from the defaults.
.IP "\fB\-\-extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "--extensions"
Give a list of the current X extensions, their versions and status.
.IP "\fB\-\-trace\fR=\fIconf\fR,\fIfont\fR,\fIicon\fR,\fIprog\fR,\fIsystray\fR" 4
.IX Item "--trace=conf,font,icon,prog,systray"
Enable tracing of the paths which are used to load configuration,
fonts, icons, executed programs, and/or system tray applets.
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
.SS "\s-1TASKBAR\s0"
.IX Subsection "TASKBAR"
On startup \fBicewm\fR launches the task bar at the bottom of the screen.
The task bar consists from left to right  of the following components:
.PP
The \fIMenu\fR button in the lower left corner gives access to the \fBicewm\fR
root menu. This menu has sub-menus to start applications, to control
\&\fBicewm\fR settings, and the \fBicewm\fR \fILogout\fR menu.
.PP
The \fIShow Desktop\fR button unmaps all application windows to fully
uncover the desktop.
.PP
The \fIWindow List Menu\fR button gives access to a menu with a list of
active windows for the current workspace and a list of workspaces
with sub-menus for their active application windows.
.PP
The \fIToolbar\fR is a list of icons for applications which are defined in
the toolbar configuration file.
.PP
The \fIWorkspace Pane\fR shows one button for each workspace.  The current
workspace is indicated by a pressed button.  Clicking another workspace
switches to that workspace.  Press left mouse, then the Shift key, then
release the left mouse, takes the current window to that workspace.
Press left, then Alt, then release left, moves only the focused window
to other workspace, without changing the current workspace.
.PP
The workspaces are defined in the \fIpreferences\fR file.  To change a name
for only this session, double click, edit the name and hit Enter.
When \f(CW\*(C`PagerShowPreview\*(C'\fR is turned on, a small graphical window summary
for each workspace is shown. They support drag-and-drop: dragging a
Firefox tab to a workspace button changes the current workspace.
Then releasing it moves that tab to a new window in that workspace.
.PP
The \fITask Pane\fR consists of a list of wide buttons for each application
which is running on the current workspace, or all workspaces if
\&\f(CW\*(C`TaskBarShowAllWindows=1\*(C'\fR.  Each task button shows the
application icon and the application title.  The active application is
indicated by a pressed button.  This is the application which has input
focus.  Pressing another button activates that application: it is
brought to the foreground and receives input focus.  Other mouse
controlled activities on the window buttons are: dragging window buttons
with the left mouse button to rearrange the order, closing the application
window with \f(CW\*(C`Alt\*(C'\fR + middle button, lowering the application window with
\&\f(CW\*(C`Ctrl\*(C'\fR + middle button, or bringing the application window to the current
workspace with \f(CW\*(C`Shift\*(C'\fR + middle button if \f(CW\*(C`TaskBarShowAllWindows=1\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If there are not many application buttons then a stretch of plain task
bar is visible.  Clicking on it with the right mouse button gives the
task bar menu.  Even with a full task pane, this menu can be usually
accessed by right-clicking the bottom right corner of the taskbar.
.PP
The \fITray Applet\fR shows system tray objects.
.PP
The \fI\s-1APM\s0 Applet\fR shows battery power status.
.PP
The \fINet Applet\fR shows network activity.  Network devices to monitor
are given by the \f(CW\*(C`NetworkStatusDevice\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
The \fIMemory Applet\fR monitors memory usage.
.PP
The \fI\s-1CPU\s0 Applet\fR monitors processor utilization.
.PP
The \fIMailbox Applet\fR monitors mailbox status changes.
See the section \s-1MAILBOX MONITORING\s0 below.
.PP
The \fIClock Applet\fR shows the current time and date.  It is configured
by the \f(CW\*(C`TimeFormat\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
The \fITask Bar Collapse\fR button collapses the task bar and hides it.
.PP
Not all \fBicewm\fR applets may show up on the task bar.  They must have
been enabled during configuration of the \fBicewm\fR software.  Their
appearance is also controlled by options in the \fIpreferences\fR file.
.SS "\s-1INPUT FOCUS\s0"
.IX Subsection "INPUT FOCUS"
Of all visible windows only one can be the active window.  This is the
window which has input focus.  It is the primary receiver of keyboard
and mouse events and hence one can interact with the application which
created that window.  A primary task of a window manager is to allow the
user to switch input focus between different windows.  The primary means
to do this is the mouse pointer.  By moving the mouse pointer over the
screen to another window, and perhaps also by clicking on a window,
input focus can be directed.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`FocusMode\*(C'\fR option controls the way \fBicewm\fR gives input focus to
applications.  It is initialized by the \fIfocus_mode\fR configuration
file.  The focus mode is set via the \fIFocus\fR menu.  \fBicewm\fR supports
six focus models:
.IP "\fB1. Click-to-focus\fR" 4
.IX Item "1. Click-to-focus"
The default focus mode.  In this mode changing input focus requires to
click a window with the left mouse button. The window is raised if
needed.  When an application requests focus its task pane button
flashes.  This gives the option to honor this request or to ignore it.
When a new application window appears it automatically receives focus.
Also when a hidden application raises to the front it receives focus.
.IP "\fB2. Sloppy-mouse-focus\fR" 4
.IX Item "2. Sloppy-mouse-focus"
Sets input focus merely by moving the mouse pointer over a window.  It
is called sloppy, because if the mouse then leaves the window and moves
to the desktop background the input focus remains with the last active
window.  When a window receives focus it is raised.  When an application
requests focus its task pane button flashes.  A new application or an
application which raises to the front automatically receives focus.
.IP "\fB3. Explicit-focus\fR" 4
.IX Item "3. Explicit-focus"
Focus is even more user-controlled than \fBClick-to-focus\fR.  When a
window receives focus it is not raised by default, unless the frame
border is clicked.  No flashing occurs when an application requests
focus.  When a new application window appears it does not receive focus.
Only by explicit clicking on a window is focus directed.
.IP "\fB4. Strict-mouse-focus\fR" 4
.IX Item "4. Strict-mouse-focus"
Like \fBSloppy\fR but focus remains with the last window. New applications
don't receive focus and are mapped behind other windows.  When an
application raises to the front it still does not get focus.
.IP "\fB5. Quiet-sloppy-focus\fR" 4
.IX Item "5. Quiet-sloppy-focus"
Like \fBSloppy\fR but no disturbing flashing occurs on the task bar when an
application requests focus.
.IP "\fB6. Custom-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "6. Custom-mode"
A focus mode which is defined in detail by ten options in the
\&\fIpreferences\fR file.
These are:
\&\f(CW\*(C`ClickToFocus\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`FocusOnAppRaise\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`RequestFocusOnAppRaise\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`RaiseOnFocus\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`RaiseOnClickClient\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`FocusChangesWorkspace\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`FocusOnMap\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`FocusOnMapTransient\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`FocusOnMapTransientActive\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`MapInactiveOnTop\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
All non-Custom focus modes override these ten options.
.PP
Apart from the mouse, \fBicewm\fR supports changing input focus in two
ways by keyboard.  By pressing \f(CW\*(C`Alt+Esc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Alt+Shift+Esc\*(C'\fR,
input focus is immediately changed to the next or previous window,
which will be raised to make it fully visible. The other method
involves the quick switch.
.SS "\s-1QUICK SWITCH\s0"
.IX Subsection "QUICK SWITCH"
The \fBQuickSwitch\fR is a means to quickly and interactively change
the input focus to another window.  It is activated by pressing the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Alt+Tab\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Alt+Shift+Tab\*(C'\fR key combination.  A window pops up
in the centre of the screen with a list of windows to choose from.
A narrow band indicates a selection: the candidate window that will
be activated to receive input focus when the Alt key is released.
.PP
The selection can be changed.  By repeatedly pressing the Tab key, one
can cycle over all windows.  If a Shift key is down, the direction of
traversal is reversed. Or use the scroll wheel of the mouse.  Or use
one of the digit keys to select the corresponding window from the list.
Arrow keys are also supported, as well as the Home and End key.
.PP
To make a selected window the active window, just release the Alt key,
or hit the Return key, or click on it.  To cancel the QuickSwitch,
press Escape or click outside of the QuickSwitch window.
.PP
A selected window can be closed by Delete, \f(CW\*(C`Alt+F4\*(C'\fR, or the middle
mouse button.  While the QuickSwitch window is up, one can still change
workspace with the usual workspace hotkeys.
.PP
The QuickSwitch has two distinct modes: vertical and horizontal.
The window list can include all windows or be limited to the current
workspace. See the many preferences available for the QuickSwitch.
.SS "\s-1WINDOW PLACEMENT\s0"
.IX Subsection "WINDOW PLACEMENT"
A second important task of a window manager is to place new windows on
the screen.  By default \fBicewm\fR chooses a placement with minimal
overlap, but this is determined by the \f(CW\*(C`SmartPlacement\*(C'\fR option in the
\&\fIpreferences\fR file.  If \f(CW\*(C`SmartPlacement\*(C'\fR is turned off then windows
are placed in sequence from left to right and top to bottom.  One can
also turn on \f(CW\*(C`ManualPlacement\*(C'\fR.  Then new windows appear initially in
the top left corner and the mouse cursor changes into a fist.  By moving
the fist cursor to a suitable location and clicking the new window will
appear at the mouse click location.
.SS "\s-1WINDOW LAYERS\s0"
.IX Subsection "WINDOW LAYERS"
Windows can overlap.  Which window appears on top is determined by three
features.  Newer windows appear over older windows.  By clicking on a
window it is raised to the top.  But both are overruled by the window
layer.  Windows can be placed in different layers via the \fILayers\fR
menu.  Click with the right mouse button on the window frame and select
\&\fILayer\fR.  From there choose one of seven window layers.  These are
ordered from higher to lower.  Windows in higher layers appear over
windows in lower layers.
.SS "\s-1WORKSPACES\s0"
.IX Subsection "WORKSPACES"
\&\fBicewm\fR supports multiple virtual desktops called workspaces.  A
workspace is like a screen where a subset of all application windows are
mapped.  Thanks to multiple workspaces we can more easily manage a
large number of applications.  The number of workspaces and their names
are configurable in the \fIpreferences\fR file through the
\&\f(CW\*(C`WorkspaceNames\*(C'\fR option.  By default four workspaces are created
with the names 1, 2, 3 and 4 thus:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& WorkspaceNames=" 1 ", " 2 ", " 3 ", " 4 "
.Ve
.PP
This syntax is typical for \fBicewm\fR options which receive multiple
values.  It is a list of comma-separated values each of which can be
quoted.
.PP
The workspaces are visible on the toolbar.  One can switch to a
different workspace by pressing the workspace button in the toolbar,
but after becoming familiar with the 'keyboard shortcuts' below one will
want to use a hotkey to choose a workspace.  If the \f(CW\*(C`EdgeSwitch\*(C'\fR
options is enabled in the \fIpreferences\fR file (with sub-options
\&\f(CW\*(C`HorizontalEdgeSwitch\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`VerticalEdgeSwitch\*(C'\fR) then one can move to
the next or previous workspace by moving the mouse to the edge of the
screen.  The \f(CW\*(C`ContinuousEdgeSwitch\*(C'\fR option enables continuous movement
to subsequent workspaces.  The \f(CW\*(C`EdgeSwitchDelay\*(C'\fR option says how long
to wait before a change of workspace occurs.
.PP
To move an application window to a different workspace one can use a
keyboard shortcut.  Another option is to select the \fIMove To\fR submenu
in the window menu of the window frame.
.SS "\s-1DRAG AND DROP\s0"
.IX Subsection "DRAG AND DROP"
The task bar supports drag and drop operations. When a drag
is in progress, the destination window can be activated by
hovering the drag icon over the task button for that window.
Alternatively, the current workspace can be changed by
hovering the drag icon over the desired workspace button.
When edge switching is enabled, the current workspace can
also be changed by bringing the drag icon to the screen edge.
.SS "\s-1ADDRESS BAR\s0"
.IX Subsection "ADDRESS BAR"
If \fBEnableAddressBar\fR=1 then \fBKeySysAddressBar\fR=\f(CW\*(C`Alt+Ctrl+Space\*(C'\fR
activates the address bar in the task bar.
If \fBShowAddressBar\fR=1 it is always shown. This is a command-line in
the task bar where a shell command can be typed.
Pressing \f(CW\*(C`Enter\*(C'\fR will execute the command.
\&\fBAddressBarCommand\fR=\f(CW\*(C`/bin/sh\*(C'\fR will be used to execute the command.
On \f(CW\*(C`Control+Enter\*(C'\fR the command is executed in a terminal
as given by \fBTerminalCommand\fR.
The address bar maintains a history which is navigable by the \fIUp\fR
and \fIDown\fR keys.
It supports command completion using \f(CW\*(C`Tab\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl+I\*(C'\fR.
A rich set of editing operations is supported,
including cut\-/copy\-/paste\-operations.
.SS "\s-1WINDOW LIST\s0"
.IX Subsection "WINDOW LIST"
The window list window shows a list of all workspaces. For each
workspace it shows the window titles of the windows which are mapped
on it. The bottom entry reads \f(CW\*(C`All Workspaces\*(C'\fR. It holds the sticky
windows. These windows are mapped in all workspaces.
.PP
The window list window is normally hidden. Choose one of the following
four methods to make it visible:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Select the bottom window list menu entry.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Press the \f(CW\*(C`KeySysWindowList=Ctrl+Alt+Esc\*(C'\fR key.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Press the right Windows key if \f(CW\*(C`Win95Keys=1\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
Press the \f(CW\*(C`DesktopWinListButton=2\*(C'\fR mouse button in the root window.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Press the middle mouse button in a workspace button on the task bar.
.PP
A single-click on a window entry selects it. A group of windows can
be selected by \f(CW\*(C`Shift+Pointer_Button1\*(C'\fR or by dragging with the left
mouse button. Use \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl+Pointer_Button1\*(C'\fR to individually select
windows in a multi-selection. A right mouse click over a selection
will popup the system menu for this selection.  To close the selected
windows, press \f(CW\*(C`Delete\*(C'\fR. Press \f(CW\*(C`Shift+Delete\*(C'\fR to forcefully kill them.
Right mouse click below the sticky windows for a menu with window
arranging actions.
.PP
Double-click on a workspace to switch to it.  Double-click on a window
to activate it.  Or navigate by arrow keys and press Enter.
The space bar toggles a selection of a window. \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl+a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl+/\*(C'\fR
will select the entire list of windows. \f(CW\*(C`Ctrl+\e\e\*(C'\fR deselects everything.
Press the first letter of a window title to navigate to it and select
it. If titles of multiple windows start with the same letter then
repeatedly pressing the first letter cycles over those windows.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Home\*(C'\fR selects the first entry and \f(CW\*(C`End\*(C'\fR the last. \f(CW\*(C`PageUp\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`PageDown\*(C'\fR move up or down by ten entries. Combine this with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Shift\*(C'\fR key to extend a selection over the range of motion.
.SS "\s-1MAILBOX MONITORING\s0"
.IX Subsection "MAILBOX MONITORING"
The task bar can show one or more icons to reflect the status of a
mailbox. The mailbox can be a local file or a remote \s-1POP\s0 or \s-1IMAP\s0
account. For this a couple of options must be set. First,
\&\fITaskBarShowMailboxStatus\fR must be enabled, which it is by default.
Then the location of the mailbox must be set.  Icewm first looks for
\&\fIMailBoxPath\fR in preferences. If this is unset, it looks at the
environment variables \f(CW\*(C`MAILPATH\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`MAIL\*(C'\fR.  \fIMailBoxPath\fR may
contain a space-separated list of mailboxes, while \f(CW\*(C`MAILPATH\*(C'\fR may
contain a colon-separated list of mailboxes.  If a mailbox starts
with a slash \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR, then it is a local file, otherwise a \s-1URL.\s0
These are six examples of possible mailboxes:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    file:///var/spool/mail/captnmark
\&    file:///home/captnmark/Maildir/
\&    pop3://markus:%2f%40%3a@maol.ch/
\&    pop3s://markus:password@pop.gmail.com/
\&    imap://mathias@localhost/INBOX.Maillisten.icewm\-user
\&    imaps://mathias:password@imap.gmail.com/INBOX
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1POP3S\s0 and \s-1IMAPS\s0 schemes use \f(CW\*(C`openssl\*(C'\fR for \s-1TLS/SSL\s0 encryption.
Note that for IceWM to access Gmail you must first configure
your Gmail account to enable \s-1POP3\s0 or \s-1IMAP\s0 access.
Make sure you have secure file permissions on your IceWM
preferences file and the directory which contains it.
.PP
Reserved characters in the password, like \fIslash\fR, \fIat\fR and \fIcolon\fR
can be specified using escape sequences with a hexadecimal encoding
like \f(CW%2f\fR for the slash or \f(CW%40\fR for the at sign.
For example, to hex-encode \f(CW\*(C`!p@a%s&s~\*(C'\fR use this Perl snippet:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    perl \-e \*(Aqforeach(split("", $ARGV[0])) { printf "%%%02x", ord($_); };
\&    print "\en";\*(Aq \*(Aq!p@a%s&s~\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Which will print:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    %21%40%23%24%25%5e%26%2a%7e
.Ve
.PP
This is the hex-encoded password. However, it is unwise to store a
password in your preferences. Consider a wallet extension for IceWM.
.PP
IceWM will check a mailbox periodically. The period in seconds can
be set by the \fIMailCheckDelay\fR option, which is 30 seconds by default.
.PP
Whenever new mail arrives, the mailbox icon will be highlighted.
The color will indicate if the mail has been read or not. Hovering
the mouse over the mailbox icon will show a tooltip with more details.
A command can be also be run on new mail. Set the \fINewMailCommand\fR
option. Its environment will have these variables set by IceWM:
.IP "\s-1ICEWM_MAILBOX\s0" 4
.IX Item "ICEWM_MAILBOX"
The mailbox index number of \fIMailBoxPath\fR starting from 1.
.IP "\s-1ICEWM_COUNT\s0" 4
.IX Item "ICEWM_COUNT"
The total number of messages in this mailbox.
.IP "\s-1ICEWM_UNREAD\s0" 4
.IX Item "ICEWM_UNREAD"
The number of unread messages in this mailbox.
.SS "\s-1KEYBOARD LAYOUT SWITCHING\s0"
.IX Subsection "KEYBOARD LAYOUT SWITCHING"
To control keyboard layouts on the task bar, define in \fIpreferences\fR
the option \fBKeyboardLayouts\fR to a comma-separated list of your
preferred keyboard layouts. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& KeyboardLayouts="de","fr","jp"
.Ve
.PP
A keyboard layout can simply be a name. Usually this is a two-letter
country code. See the directory \fI/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols\fR for
a list of available keyboard layouts for your system.  If it is
enclosed in double quotes, it can also be a space-separated list of
command-line arguments to an invocation of the \f(CW\*(C`setxkbmap\*(C'\fR program.
.PP
The first layout is the default. It will be installed when icewm starts.
The task bar will show the current keyboard layout. If an icon can
be found for the first two letters of the layout, then that icon
will be shown. Otherwise the first two letters of the name of the
layout will be shown.
.PP
Click on the current keyboard layout to cycle through all the
available keyboard layouts. Click with the right mouse button
to open a menu of all available keyboard layouts.
.PP
It is also possible to configure a default keyboard layout for
each program individually in the \fBicewm\-winoptions\fR\|(5) file.
Whenever such a program receives input focus, icewm will install
this configured keyboard layout automatically. The keyboard status
on the task bar will be updated to reflect this.
.PP
Please note that for keyboard layout switching to work, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`setxkbmap\*(C'\fR program must be installed. To see your current
keyboard layout settings, do \f(CW\*(C`setxkbmap \-query\*(C'\fR.
.SS "\s-1KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\s0"
.IX Subsection "KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS"
\&\fBicewm\fR supports a large number of hotkeys to activate some behaviour
with a single key combination.  These are all configurable in the
\&\fIpreferences\fR file.  Here we give their preferences name, followed by
their default value in double quotes, and a short descriptions of their
effect.
.PP
Note that all use one or more key modifiers. Icewm supports the
following modifiers: Alt, AltGr, Ctrl, Hyper, Meta, Shift, Super.
Setting \fBModSuperIsCtrlAlt=1\fR makes the Super modifier an alias
for Ctrl+Alt.

.Sp
See \fBicewm\-programs\fR\|(5).
.IP "\fItheme\fR" 4
.IX Item "theme"
This file contains the name of the default theme.  On startup \fBicewm\fR
reads this file to obtain the theme name, unless \fBicewm\fR was started
with the \fB\-\-theme\fR option.  Whenever a different theme is selected from
the \fBicewm\fR Menu then the theme file is overwritten with the name of
the selected theme.  This theme file contains the keyword \f(CW\*(C`Theme\*(C'\fR,
followed by an equals sign, followed by a double-quoted string with the
theme name.  The theme name is the name of the theme directory, followed
by a slash, followed by the theme file.  Usually the theme file is just
\&\fIdefault.theme\fR, but a theme may have alternatives.  Alternatives are
small tweaks of a theme.  These are specified in their own \fI.theme\fR
file, which replaces \fIdefault.theme\fR.  If no theme file exists then
\&\fBicewm\fR will use the default setting of

.Sp
See \fBicewm\-theme\fR\|(5).
.IP "\fItoolbar\fR" 4
.IX Item "toolbar"
Contains names of quick to launch applications with icons for the task
bar.  Each non-empty non-comment line starts with the keyword \fBprog\fR.
After one or more spaces follows a name, which is displayed in a tool
tip whenever the mouse cursor hovers over the toolbar icon.  This name
may be a double quoted string.  Then follows the bare name of the icon
to use without extensions.  This icon will be shown in the toolbar.  The
last component is a shell command-line which will be executed whenever
the user presses the icon in the toolbar.  For example, the following
line in toolbar will create a button with tool tip \f(CW\*(C`Mozilla Firefox\*(C'\fR
with the \fIfirefox\fR icon which launches \fBfirefox\fR\|(1) when clicked:

Contains icons which are used to identify applications.  Usually these
files are in the \s-1XPM\s0 format, but the \s-1PNG\s0 and \s-1SVG\s0 image formats are also
supported.  The names of icon files may follow a specific naming
pattern, like \fIapp_32x32.xpm\fR.  They start with a base name, usually
this is just a single word.  Then follows an underscore, followed by a
size specification in the format \f(CW\*(C`SIZExSIZE\*(C'\fR.  This is followed by a
dot and the file extension, where the extension denotes the icon image
format.  Common sizes are 16, 32 and 48 for small, large and huge icons.
This depends on the respective \f(CW\*(C`IconSize\*(C'\fR preferences options.
.IP "\fIledclock\fR" 4
.IX Item "ledclock"
Pictures of digits for the \s-1LED\s0 clock which is displayed in the

.SS "\s-1OPACITY\s0"
.IX Subsection "OPACITY"
IceWM supports window opacity and transparency in connection with an
external compositor like \fBcompton\fR\|(1) or \fBpicom\fR\|(1).
If a client window sets the \f(CW\*(C`_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY\*(C'\fR property on
its window, then \fBicewm\fR will copy this to the outer frame window,
where the compositor will read it and adjust the opacity accordingly.
.PP
The opacity can also be set in the \fBicewm\-winoptions\fR\|(5) file.
\&\fBicesh\fR\|(1) can control the opacity level of running applications.
.PP
The _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE properties which \fBicewm\fR sets on its windows
are \fI\s-1DIALOG\s0\fR, \fI\s-1NOTIFICATION\s0\fR, \fI\s-1POPUP_MENU\s0\fR and \fI\s-1TOOLTIP\s0\fR. The output
