.SH SYNOPSIS

All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You
may use either white space or equals signs between an option name and
its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR "Netpbm" (1)\c
\&.
.PP
\fBwinicontopam\fP reads a Microsoft Windows icon file and converts it to
one or more RGB_ALPHA Netpbm PAM images.
.PP
There are two kinds of transparency information a a Windows icon can have:
and mask and graded transparency map.  The and mask is older and indicates for
each pixel whether it is fully opaque or fully transparent.  The graded
transparency map can indicate translucent values too.  The graded transparency
map is present in an icon that uses PNG encoding or uses BMP encoding with 32
bits per pixel.
.PP
The transparency plane in the PAM output of \fBwinicontopam\fP comes from
  the graded transparency map if it exists and the and mask otherwise.
.PP
An icon may actually have both forms of transparency information.  See
\fB-andmasks\fP.
.PP
The output goes to Standard Output.
.PP
The output is a multi-image PAM file.  If you want a separate file for
each image, use
.BR "\fBpamsplit\fP" (1)\c
\&.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
(most notably \fB-quiet\fP, see 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
 Common Options
.UE
\&), \fBwinicontopam\fP recognizes the following
command line options:



.TP
\fB-allimages\fP
Convert all images in the input.
.sp
You may not specify this together with \fB-image\fP.
.sp
By default, \fBwinicontopam\fP converts only the one "best
quality" image (largest, then most bits per pixel).

.TP
\fB-image=\fP\fIindex\fP
Convert image number \fIindex\fP (starting with zero).
.sp
You may not specify this together with \fB-allimages\fP.
.sp
By default, \fBwinicontopam\fP converts the "best quality"
image (largest, then most bits per pixel).

.TP
\fB-andmasks\fP
If the image to be extracted contains both graded transparency data and an
AND mask, produce five-channel Netpbm PAM images with the AND mask as the
fifth plane.  An image that formally has graded transparency data, but it
indicates nothing but opaque pixels is considered not to have graded
transparency data, so \fB-andmasks\fP would have no effect on it.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print more messages

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBwinicontopam\fP was new in Netpbm 10.63 (June 2013).  It obsoleted
\fBwinicontoppm\fP by providing more function and conforming better to Netpbm
conventions.
