.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
It is usually impossible to add new syntax to Perl without breaking
some existing programs.  This pragma provides a way to minimize that
risk. New syntactic constructs, or new semantic meanings to older
constructs, can be enabled by \f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, and will be parsed
only when the appropriate feature pragma is in scope.  (Nevertheless, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`CORE::\*(C'\fR prefix provides access to all Perl keywords, regardless of this
pragma.)
.SS "Lexical effect"
.IX Subsection "Lexical effect"
Like other pragmas (\f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR, for example), features have a lexical
effect.  \f(CW\*(C`use feature qw(foo)\*(C'\fR will only make the feature \*(L"foo\*(R" available
from that point to the end of the enclosing block.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    {
\&        use feature \*(Aqsay\*(Aq;
\&        say "say is available here";
\&    }
\&    print "But not here.\en";
.Ve
.ie n .SS """no feature"""
.el .SS "\f(CWno feature\fP"
.IX Subsection "no feature"
Features can also be turned off by using \f(CW\*(C`no feature "foo"\*(C'\fR.  This too
has lexical effect.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    use feature \*(Aqsay\*(Aq;
\&    say "say is available here";
\&    {
\&        no feature \*(Aqsay\*(Aq;
\&        print "But not here.\en";
\&    }
\&    say "Yet it is here.";
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`no feature\*(C'\fR with no features specified will reset to the default group.  To
disable \fIall\fR features (an unusual request!) use \f(CW\*(C`no feature \*(Aq:all\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.
.SH "AVAILABLE FEATURES"
.IX Header "AVAILABLE FEATURES"
.SS "The 'say' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'say' feature"
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqsay\*(Aq\*(C'\fR tells the compiler to enable the Raku-inspired
\&\f(CW\*(C`say\*(C'\fR function.
.PP
See \*(L"say\*(R" in perlfunc for details.
.PP
This feature is available starting with Perl 5.10.
.SS "The 'state' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'state' feature"
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqstate\*(Aq\*(C'\fR tells the compiler to enable \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR
variables.
.PP
See \*(L"Persistent Private Variables\*(R" in perlsub for details.
.PP
This feature is available starting with Perl 5.10.
.SS "The 'switch' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'switch' feature"
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: This feature is still experimental and the implementation may
change or be removed in future versions of Perl.  For this reason, Perl will
warn when you use the feature, unless you have explicitly disabled the warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::smartmatch";
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqswitch\*(Aq\*(C'\fR tells the compiler to enable the Raku
given/when construct.
.PP
See \*(L"Switch Statements\*(R" in perlsyn for details.
.PP
This feature is available starting with Perl 5.10.
.SS "The 'unicode_strings' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'unicode_strings' feature"
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fR tells the compiler to use Unicode rules
in all string operations executed within its scope (unless they are also
within the scope of either \f(CW\*(C`use locale\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use bytes\*(C'\fR).  The same applies
to all regular expressions compiled within the scope, even if executed outside
it.  It does not change the internal representation of strings, but only how
they are interpreted.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`no feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fR tells the compiler to use the traditional
Perl rules wherein the native character set rules is used unless it is
clear to Perl that Unicode is desired.  This can lead to some surprises
when the behavior suddenly changes.  (See
\&\*(L"The \*(R"Unicode Bug"" in perlunicode for details.)  For this reason, if you are
potentially using Unicode in your program, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqunicode_strings\*(Aq\*(C'\fR subpragma is \fBstrongly\fR recommended.
.PP
This feature is available starting with Perl 5.12; was almost fully
implemented in Perl 5.14; and extended in Perl 5.16 to cover \f(CW\*(C`quotemeta\*(C'\fR;
was extended further in Perl 5.26 to cover the range
operator; and was extended again in Perl 5.28 to
cover special-cased whitespace splitting.
.SS "The 'unicode_eval' and 'evalbytes' features"
.IX Subsection "The 'unicode_eval' and 'evalbytes' features"
Together, these two features are intended to replace the legacy string
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR function, which behaves problematically in some instances.  They are
available starting with Perl 5.16, and are enabled by default by a
\&\f(CW\*(C`use 5.16\*(C'\fR or higher declaration.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`unicode_eval\*(C'\fR changes the behavior of plain string \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR to work more
consistently, especially in the Unicode world.  Certain (mis)behaviors
couldn't be changed without breaking some things that had come to rely on
them, so the feature can be enabled and disabled.  Details are at
\&\*(L"Under the \*(R"unicode_eval\*(L" feature\*(R" in perlfunc.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`evalbytes\*(C'\fR is like string \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, but it treats its argument as a byte
string. Details are at \*(L"evalbytes \s-1EXPR\*(R"\s0 in perlfunc.  Without a
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqevalbytes\*(Aq\*(C'\fR nor a \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR (or higher) declaration in
the current scope, you can still access it by instead writing
\&\f(CW\*(C`CORE::evalbytes\*(C'\fR.
.SS "The 'current_sub' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'current_sub' feature"
This provides the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_SUB_\|_\*(C'\fR token that returns a reference to the current
subroutine or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR outside of a subroutine.
.PP
This feature is available starting with Perl 5.16.
.SS "The 'array_base' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'array_base' feature"
This feature supported the legacy \f(CW$[\fR variable.  See \*(L"$[\*(R" in perlvar.
It was on by default but disabled under \f(CW\*(C`use v5.16\*(C'\fR (see
\&\*(L"\s-1IMPLICIT LOADING\*(R"\s0, below) and unavailable since perl 5.30.
.PP
This feature is available under this name starting with Perl 5.16.  In
previous versions, it was simply on all the time, and this pragma knew
nothing about it.
.SS "The 'fc' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'fc' feature"
\&\f(CW\*(C`use feature \*(Aqfc\*(Aq\*(C'\fR tells the compiler to enable the \f(CW\*(C`fc\*(C'\fR function,
which implements Unicode casefolding.
.PP
See \*(L"fc\*(R" in perlfunc for details.
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.16 onwards.
.SS "The 'lexical_subs' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'lexical_subs' feature"
In Perl versions prior to 5.26, this feature enabled
declaration of subroutines via \f(CW\*(C`my sub foo\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`state sub foo\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`our sub foo\*(C'\fR syntax.  See \*(L"Lexical Subroutines\*(R" in perlsub for details.
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.18 onwards.  From Perl 5.18 to 5.24,
it was classed as experimental, and Perl emitted a warning for its
usage, except when explicitly disabled:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  no warnings "experimental::lexical_subs";
.Ve
.PP
As of Perl 5.26, use of this feature no longer triggers a warning, though
the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::lexical_subs\*(C'\fR warning category still exists (for
compatibility with code that disables it).  In addition, this syntax is
not only no longer experimental, but it is enabled for all Perl code,
regardless of what feature declarations are in scope.
.SS "The 'postderef' and 'postderef_qq' features"
.IX Subsection "The 'postderef' and 'postderef_qq' features"
The 'postderef_qq' feature extends the applicability of postfix
dereference syntax so that postfix array
and scalar dereference are available in double-quotish interpolations. For
example, it makes the following two statements equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $s = "[@{ $h\->{a} }]";
\&  my $s = "[$h\->{a}\->@*]";
.Ve
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.20 onwards. In Perl 5.20 and 5.22, it
was classed as experimental, and Perl emitted a warning for its
usage, except when explicitly disabled:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  no warnings "experimental::postderef";
.Ve
.PP
As of Perl 5.24, use of this feature no longer triggers a warning, though
the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::postderef\*(C'\fR warning category still exists (for
compatibility with code that disables it).
.PP
The 'postderef' feature was used in Perl 5.20 and Perl 5.22 to enable
postfix dereference syntax outside double-quotish interpolations. In those
versions, using it triggered the \f(CW\*(C`experimental::postderef\*(C'\fR warning in the
same way as the 'postderef_qq' feature did. As of Perl 5.24, this syntax is
not only no longer experimental, but it is enabled for all Perl code,
regardless of what feature declarations are in scope.
.SS "The 'signatures' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'signatures' feature"
This enables syntax for declaring subroutine arguments as lexical variables.
For example, for this subroutine:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    sub foo ($left, $right) {
\&        return $left + $right;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Calling \f(CW\*(C`foo(3, 7)\*(C'\fR will assign \f(CW3\fR into \f(CW$left\fR and \f(CW7\fR into \f(CW$right\fR.
.PP
See \*(L"Signatures\*(R" in perlsub for details.
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.20 onwards. From Perl 5.20 to 5.34,
it was classed as experimental, and Perl emitted a warning for its usage,
except when explicitly disabled:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  no warnings "experimental::signatures";
.Ve
.PP
As of Perl 5.36, use of this feature no longer triggers a warning, though the
\&\f(CW\*(C`experimental::signatures\*(C'\fR warning category still exists (for compatibility
with code that disables it). This feature is now considered stable, and is
enabled automatically by \f(CW\*(C`use v5.36\*(C'\fR (or higher).
.SS "The 'refaliasing' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'refaliasing' feature"
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: This feature is still experimental and the implementation may
change or be removed in future versions of Perl.  For this reason, Perl will
warn when you use the feature, unless you have explicitly disabled the warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::refaliasing";
.Ve
.PP
This enables aliasing via assignment to references:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    \e$a = \e$b; # $a and $b now point to the same scalar
\&    \e@a = \e@b; #                     to the same array
\&    \e%a = \e%b;
\&    \e&a = \e&b;
\&    foreach \e%hash (@array_of_hash_refs) {
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"Assigning to References\*(R" in perlref for details.
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.22 onwards.
.SS "The 'bitwise' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'bitwise' feature"
This makes the four standard bitwise operators (\f(CW\*(C`& | ^ ~\*(C'\fR) treat their
operands consistently as numbers, and introduces four new dotted operators
(\f(CW\*(C`&. |. ^. ~.\*(C'\fR) that treat their operands consistently as strings.  The
same applies to the assignment variants (\f(CW\*(C`&= |= ^= &.= |.= ^.=\*(C'\fR).
.PP
See \*(L"Bitwise String Operators\*(R" in perlop for details.
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.22 onwards.  Starting in Perl 5.28,
\&\f(CW\*(C`use v5.28\*(C'\fR will enable the feature.  Before 5.28, it was still
experimental and would emit a warning in the \*(L"experimental::bitwise\*(R"
category.
.SS "The 'declared_refs' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'declared_refs' feature"
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: This feature is still experimental and the implementation may
change or be removed in future versions of Perl.  For this reason, Perl will
warn when you use the feature, unless you have explicitly disabled the warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::declared_refs";
.Ve
.PP
This allows a reference to a variable to be declared with \f(CW\*(C`my\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`state\*(C'\fR,
our \f(CW\*(C`our\*(C'\fR, or localized with \f(CW\*(C`local\*(C'\fR.  It is intended mainly for use in
conjunction with the \*(L"refaliasing\*(R" feature.  See \*(L"Declaring a
Reference to a Variable\*(R" in perlref for examples.
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.26 onwards.
.SS "The 'isa' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'isa' feature"
This allows the use of the \f(CW\*(C`isa\*(C'\fR infix operator, which tests whether the
scalar given by the left operand is an object of the class given by the
right operand. See \*(L"Class Instance Operator\*(R" in perlop for more details.
.PP
This feature is available from Perl 5.32 onwards.  From Perl 5.32 to 5.34,
it was classed as experimental, and Perl emitted a warning for its usage,
except when explicitly disabled:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::isa";
.Ve
.PP
As of Perl 5.36, use of this feature no longer triggers a warning (though the
\&\f(CW\*(C`experimental::isa\*(C'\fR warning category stilll exists for compatibility with
code that disables it). This feature is now considered stable, and is enabled
automatically by \f(CW\*(C`use v5.36\*(C'\fR (or higher).
.SS "The 'indirect' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'indirect' feature"
This feature allows the use of indirect object
syntax for method calls, e.g.  \f(CW\*(C`new
Foo 1, 2;\*(C'\fR. It is enabled by default, but can be turned off to
disallow indirect object syntax.
.PP
This feature is available under this name from Perl 5.32 onwards. In
previous versions, it was simply on all the time.  To disallow (or
warn on) indirect object syntax on older Perls, see the indirect
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 module.
.SS "The 'multidimensional' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'multidimensional' feature"
This feature enables multidimensional array emulation, a perl 4 (or
earlier) feature that was used to emulate multidimensional arrays with
hashes.  This works by converting code like \f(CW$foo{$x, $y}\fR into
\&\f(CW$foo{join($;, $x, $y)}\fR.  It is enabled by default, but can be
turned off to disable multidimensional array emulation.
.PP
When this feature is disabled the syntax that is normally replaced
will report a compilation error.
.PP
This feature is available under this name from Perl 5.34 onwards. In
previous versions, it was simply on all the time.
.PP
You can use the multidimensional module on \s-1CPAN\s0 to disable
multidimensional array emulation for older versions of Perl.
.SS "The 'bareword_filehandles' feature."
.IX Subsection "The 'bareword_filehandles' feature."
This feature enables bareword filehandles for builtin functions
operations, a generally discouraged practice.  It is enabled by
default, but can be turned off to disable bareword filehandles, except
for the exceptions listed below.
.PP
The perl built-in filehandles \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`ARGV\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ARGVOUT\*(C'\fR and the special \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR are always enabled.
.PP
This feature is enabled under this name from Perl 5.34 onwards.  In
previous versions it was simply on all the time.
.PP
You can use the bareword::filehandles module on \s-1CPAN\s0 to disable
bareword filehandles for older versions of perl.
.SS "The 'try' feature."
.IX Subsection "The 'try' feature."
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: This feature is still experimental and the implementation may
change or be removed in future versions of Perl.  For this reason, Perl will
warn when you use the feature, unless you have explicitly disabled the warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::try";
.Ve
.PP
This feature enables the \f(CW\*(C`try\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR syntax, which allows exception
handling, where exceptions thrown from the body of the block introduced with
\&\f(CW\*(C`try\*(C'\fR are caught by executing the body of the \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR block.
.PP
For more information, see \*(L"Try Catch Exception Handling\*(R" in perlsyn.
.SS "The 'defer' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'defer' feature"
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: This feature is still experimental and the implementation may
change or be removed in future versions of Perl.  For this reason, Perl will
warn when you use the feature, unless you have explicitly disabled the warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::defer";
.Ve
.PP
This feature enables the \f(CW\*(C`defer\*(C'\fR block syntax, which allows a block of code
to be deferred until when the flow of control leaves the block which contained
it. For more details, see \*(L"defer\*(R" in perlsyn.
.SS "The 'extra_paired_delimiters' feature"
.IX Subsection "The 'extra_paired_delimiters' feature"
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: This feature is still experimental and the implementation may
change or be removed in future versions of Perl.  For this reason, Perl will
warn when you use the feature, unless you have explicitly disabled the warning:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    no warnings "experimental::extra_paired_delimiters";
.Ve
.PP
This feature enables the use of more paired string delimiters than the
traditional four, \f(CW\*(C`<  >\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`( )\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`{ }\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`[ ]\*(C'\fR.  When
this feature is on, for example, you can say \f(CW\*(C`qr«pat»\*(C'\fR.

.SH "IMPLICIT LOADING"
.IX Header "IMPLICIT LOADING"
Instead of loading feature bundles by name, it is easier to let Perl do
implicit loading of a feature bundle for you.
.PP
There are two ways to load the \f(CW\*(C`feature\*(C'\fR pragma implicitly:
.IP "\(bu" 4
By using the \f(CW\*(C`\-E\*(C'\fR switch on the Perl command-line instead of \f(CW\*(C`\-e\*(C'\fR.
That will enable the feature bundle for that version of Perl in the
main compilation unit (that is, the one-liner that follows \f(CW\*(C`\-E\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
By explicitly requiring a minimum Perl version number for your program, with
the \f(CW\*(C`use VERSION\*(C'\fR construct.  That is,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use v5.10.0;
.Ve
.Sp
will do an implicit
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    no feature \*(Aq:all\*(Aq;
\&    use feature \*(Aq:5.10\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
and so on.  Note how the trailing sub-version
is automatically stripped from the
version.
.Sp
But to avoid portability warnings (see \*(L"use\*(R" in perlfunc), you may prefer:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use 5.010;
.Ve
.Sp
with the same effect.
.Sp
If the required version is older than Perl 5.10, the \*(L":default\*(R" feature
bundle is automatically loaded instead.
.Sp
Unlike \f(CW\*(C`use feature ":5.12"\*(C'\fR, saying \f(CW\*(C`use v5.12\*(C'\fR (or any higher version)
also does the equivalent of \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR; see \*(L"use\*(R" in perlfunc for details.
.SH "CHECKING FEATURES"
.IX Header "CHECKING FEATURES"
\&\f(CW\*(C`feature\*(C'\fR provides some simple APIs to check which features are enabled.
.PP
These functions cannot be imported and must be called by their fully
qualified names.  If you don't otherwise need to set a feature you will
need to ensure \f(CW\*(C`feature\*(C'\fR is loaded with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use feature ();
.Ve
.IP "feature_enabled($feature)" 4
.IX Item "feature_enabled($feature)"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "feature_enabled($feature, $depth)" 4
.el .IP "feature_enabled($feature, \f(CW$depth\fR)" 4
.IX Item "feature_enabled($feature, $depth)"
.PD
.Vb 6
\&  package MyStandardEnforcer;
\&  use feature ();
\&  use Carp "croak";
\&  sub import {
\&    croak "disable indirect!" if feature::feature_enabled("indirect");
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
Test whether a named feature is enabled at a given level in the call
stack, returning a true value if it is.  \f(CW$depth\fR defaults to 1,
which checks the scope that called the scope calling
\&\fBfeature::feature_enabled()\fR.
.Sp
croaks for an unknown feature name.
.IP "\fBfeatures_enabled()\fR" 4
.IX Item "features_enabled()"
.PD 0
.IP "features_enabled($depth)" 4
.IX Item "features_enabled($depth)"
.PD
.Vb 5
\&  package ReportEnabledFeatures;
\&  use feature "say";
\&  sub import {
\&    say STDERR join " ", feature::features_enabled();
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
Returns a list of the features enabled at a given level in the call
stack.  \f(CW$depth\fR defaults to 1, which checks the scope that called
the scope calling \fBfeature::features_enabled()\fR.
.IP "\fBfeature_bundle()\fR" 4
.IX Item "feature_bundle()"
.PD 0
.IP "feature_bundle($depth)" 4
.IX Item "feature_bundle($depth)"
.PD
Returns the feature bundle, if any, selected at a given level in the
call stack.  \f(CW$depth\fR defaults to 1, which checks the scope that called
the scope calling \fBfeature::feature_bundle()\fR.
.Sp
Returns an undefined value if no feature bundle is selected in the
scope.
.Sp
The bundle name returned will be for the earliest bundle matching the
selected bundle, so:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  use feature ();
\&  use v5.12;
\&  BEGIN { print feature::feature_bundle(0); }
.Ve
.Sp
will print \f(CW5.11\fR.
.Sp
This returns internal state, at this point \f(CW\*(C`use v5.12;\*(C'\fR sets the
feature bundle, but \f(CW\*(C` use feature ":5.12"; \*(C'\fR does not set the feature
bundle.  This may change in a future release of perl.
