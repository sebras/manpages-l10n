.SH NAME
psnup - put multiple pages of a PostScript document on to one page
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psnup
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR...] \fI\,-NUP \/\fR[\fI\,INFILE \/\fR[\fI\,OUTFILE\/\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Put multiple pages of a PostScript document on to one page.
.TP
\fB\-NUMBER\fR
number of pages to impose on each output page
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-paper\fR=\fI\,PAPER\/\fR
output paper name or dimensions
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-inpaper\fR=\fI\,PAPER\/\fR
input paper name or dimensions
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-margin\fR=\fI\,DIMENSION\/\fR
width of margin around each output page
[default 0pt]; useful for thumbnail sheets,
as the original page margins will be shrunk
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-border\fR=\fI\,DIMENSION\/\fR
width of border around each input page
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-draw\fR[=\fI\,DIMENSION\/\fR]
draw a line of given width around each page
[relative to input page size; argument defaults to
1pt; default is no line]
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-rotatedleft\fR
input pages are rotated left 90 degrees
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-rotatedright\fR
input pages are rotated right 90 degrees
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-flip\fR
swap output pages' width and height
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-transpose\fR
swap columns and rows (column\-major order)
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tolerance\fR=\fI\,NUMBER\/\fR
maximum wasted area in square pt [default: 100,000]
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
don't show page numbers being output
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
display version information and exit
.PP
psnup aborts with an error if it cannot arrange the input pages so as to
waste less than the given tolerance.
.PP
The output paper size defaults to the input paper size; if that is not given,
the default given by the `paper' command is used.
.PP
The input paper size defaults to the output paper size.
.PP
In row\-major order (the default), adjacent pages are placed in rows across
the paper; in column\-major order, they are placed in columns down the page.
.PP
.B psnup
uses
.B pstops
to impose multiple logical pages on to each physical sheet of paper.
.PP
Paper sizes can be given either as a name (see
.BR paper(1) )
or as \fBwidth\fRx\fBheight\fR (see
.BR psutils (1)
for the available units).

.SS "Exit status:"
.TP
0
if OK,
.TP
1
if arguments or options are incorrect, or there is some other problem
starting up,
.TP
2
if there is some problem during processing, typically an error reading or
writing an input or output file.
.SH EXAMPLES
The potential use of this utility is varied but one particular 
use is in conjunction with 
.BR psbook (1).
For example, using groff to create a PostScript document and lpr as 
the 
.SM UNIX 
print spooler a typical command line might look like this: 
.sp
groff -Tps -ms \fIfile\fP | psbook | psnup -2 | lpr
.sp
where file is a 4 page document this command will result in a 
two page document printing two pages of \fIfile\fP per page and
rearranges the page order to match the input pages 4 and 1 
on the first output page and
pages 2 then 3 of the input document 
on the second output page.
