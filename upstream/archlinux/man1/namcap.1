.SH NAME
namcap \- package analysis utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnamcap [options] <package|PKGBUILD> [package|PKGBUILD] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBnamcap\fP is a \fIpackage analysis\fP utility that looks for problems with Arch Linux packages or their PKGBUILD files.  It can apply rules to the file list, the files themselves, or individual PKGBUILD files.
.PP
Rules return lists of messages.  Each message can be one of three types: error, warning, or information (think of them as notes or comments).  Errors (designated by 'E:') are things that namcap is very sure are wrong and need to be fixed.  Warnings (designated by 'W:') are things that namcap thinks should be changed but if you know what you're doing then you can leave them.  Information (designated 'I:') are only shown when you use the info argument.  Information messages give information that might be helpful but isn't anything that needs changing.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-e\fR RULELIST, \fB\-\-exclude=\fRRULELIST
Do not run RULELIST rules on the package
.TP
.B "\-i, \-\-info"
display information messages
.TP
.B "\-L, \-\-list
return a list of valid rules and their descriptions
.TP
.B "\-m, \-\-machine\-readable"
displays easily parseable namcap tags instead of the normal human readable description; for example using non-fhs-man-page instead of "Non-FHS man page (%s) found. Use /usr/share/man instead". A full list of namcap tags along with their human readable descriptions can be found at /usr/share/namcap/tags.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR RULELIST, \fB\-\-rules=\fRRULELIST
only apply RULELIST rules to the package
.IP
RULELIST is a comma-separated list of rule names
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-version"
print version and exit
.SH RULES
.TP
.B arrays
Verifies that array variables are actually arrays and not strings
.TP
.B badbackups
Verifies that backup entries don't begin with /
.TP
.B carch
Looks for references to i686 and i586 and tells you to use $CARCH instead
.TP
.B capsnames
Checks a PKGBUILD to verify that the package name has no upper case characters
.TP
.B capsnamespkg
Checks a package to verify that the package name has no upper case characters
.TP
.B checksums
Makes sure that a PKGBUILD includes valid checksums
.TP
.B depends
This module runs ldd on all executables, gets the link-level dependencies, finds the smallest subset of dependencies that cover the link-level dependencies, and compares that list to the depends of the package.  It returns messages in three cases: dependency detected and not included, dependency included but already satisfied, and dependency included and not needed.  These suggestions are just guidelines and all package builders should take this into account (i.e. you're smarter than namcap is)

Some cases where namcap fails are dlopen() and obscure links.  dlopen()'d libraries don't show up because they are loaded at run time: in the case of a program that loads plugins.  Obscure links are the cases where only a small portion of the package needs something to run; usually, the small portion won't be accessed unless that thing is installed (i.e. a java plugin for mozilla included in the java package).
.TP
.B directoryname
Checks the directory names in the package file list for standard directories (i.e. /etc, /usr/bin, /usr/lib).  All files in directories that are non-standard are returned
.TP
.B elffiles
Gives an error if it finds ELF (binary) files outside the standard paths (/bin, /usr/bin, etc.)
.TP
.B emptydir
Looks for directories in a package that don't contain any files
.TP
.B extravars
Verifies that extra variables start with an underscore
.TP
.B fhsinfopages
Verifies correct installation of info pages
.TP
.B fhsmanpages
Verifies correct installation of man pages
.TP
.B fileownership
Verifies that all files are owned by root:root and not some other user or group
.TP
.B gnomemime
Checks for generated GNOME mime files
.TP
.B hicoloricons
Checks whether the hicolor icon cache is updated when a package installs
files in /usr/share/icons/hicolor
.TP
.B infodirectory
Verifies that a package does not contain the info directory file (/usr/share/info/dir)
.TP
.B invalidstartdir
Any PKGBUILDs that refer to files in $startdir are incorrect
.TP
.B libtool
Warns if libtool (*.la) files are present
.TP
.B license
Verifies that the licenses variable has been filled in in a PKGBUILD.
.TP
.B licensepkg
Verifies that the licenses variable has been filled in in a package. For packages with a custom license it
checks whether the license file has been installed in
/usr/share/licenses/$pkgname/
.TP
.B perllocal
Searches for perllocal.pod.  perllocal.pod is a nasty file that's included during most perl module installations
.TP
.B permissions
Checks basic file and and directory permissions.  It returns warnings about world readable bits not being set, world writable bits being set, and world executable bit not being set for directories
.TP
.B rpath
Gives an error if a binary has RPATH set to something other than /usr/lib
.TP
.B runpath
Gives an error if a binary has RUNPATH set to something other than /usr/lib, /usr/lib32
.TP
.B scrollkeeper
Verifies that there aren't any scrollkeeper directories
.TP
.B sfurl
Warns if a PKGBUILD is downloading from a specific sourceforge mirror instead of the generic downloads.sourceforge.net
.TP
.B symlink
Finds out symbolic and hard links which do not point to a valid path in the package
.TP
.B tags
For package maintainers, this module verifies that we have remembered to add a Maintainer and Contributor comment.
.TP
.B url
Verifies that we have the url variable set in the PKGBUILD
.TP
.B urlpkg
Verifies that we have the url variable set in the package file
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B namcap foo.pkg.tar.gz
apply all rules to foo.pkg.tar.gz
.TP
.B namcap -r depends,symlink foo.pkg.tar.gz
apply the depends and symlink rules to foo.pkg.tar.gz
.TP
.B namcap PKGBUILD
apply all PKGBUILD based rules to the file PKGBUILD
.TP
.B namcap --list
list all of the available rules
