.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.IP "\fBicesh\fR \fIOPTIONS|ACTIONS\fR+" 4
.IX Item "icesh OPTIONS|ACTIONS+"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBicesh\fR provides commands to directly interact with the \fBicewm\fR\|(1) window
manager.  There are two types of commands:
.IP "1. Commands to directly interact with icewm:" 4
.IX Item "1. Commands to directly interact with icewm:"
These are listed in the section \*(L"\s-1MANAGER ACTIONS\*(R"\s0 below.
They are easy to use, because they don't require to select one
or more windows. For example, \f(CW\*(C`icesh restart\*(C'\fR will restart
icewm and \f(CW\*(C`icesh clients\*(C'\fR lists the applications which
are managed by icewm.
.IP "2. Commands which operate on a selection of windows:" 4
.IX Item "2. Commands which operate on a selection of windows:"
See the section \f(CW\*(C`WINDOW ACTIONS\*(C'\fR below. For example, \f(CW\*(C`icesh close\*(C'\fR
is a request to close a window, but which window? Now icesh
will turn the mouse pointer into a crosshair. Click on a window
and a close request will be sent to that application.
.Sp
The power of icesh lies in its ability to programmatically
select one or more windows and operate on that selection.
This can be used in scripts and in \fBicewm\-keys\fR\|(5)
to define your own window management hotkeys.  For example, to
immediately close all xterm windows do \f(CW\*(C`icesh \-c xterm close\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
There are about seven \f(CW\*(C`SELECT OPTIONS\*(C'\fR to select windows.
They start with a minus sign '\-' or with a plus sign '+'.
The first starts a new selection. The second adds more
windows to an existing selection.
.Sp
This selection of windows can be reduced by \f(CW\*(C`FILTER OPTIONS\*(C'\fR.
These remove unwanted windows from the current selection.
Multiple filter options can be given. For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`icesh \-c xterm \-W this close\*(C'\fR will close only those xterms
which are shown on the current workspace. The xterms on other
workspaces are filtered out by the \f(CW\*(C`\-W this\*(C'\fR filter option.
.PP
There is no limit to the number of commands, selections, filters
and actions which you can give to a single icesh command.
They are processed and evaluated one by one from left to right.
This makes icesh a small declarative programming language.
Have a look at some examples near the end of this document.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
\&\fBicesh\fR recognizes the following options:
.SS "\s-1SELECT OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "SELECT OPTIONS"
Select options specify the window or windows to which subsequent
actions apply. If none is given, but an action does require a window,
then a selection crossbar is invoked to select the desired window
interactively. The manager actions do not require window options.
.PP
The following five options \fIselect\fR one or more client windows.
If needed, they can be repeated for successive actions.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-window\fR, \fB+w\fR, \fB+window\fR \fI\s-1WINDOW_ID\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w, -window, +w, +window WINDOW_ID"
Specifies the identifier of the window, \fI\s-1WINDOW_ID\s0\fR, for which the
action applies.  Special identifiers are \fBroot\fR for the root window
and \fBfocus\fR for the currently focused window.
The option with minus sign replaces the existing selection.
With a plus sign the window is added to an existing selection.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-root\fR, \fB+r\fR, \fB+root\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, -root, +r, +root"
Is equivalent to \fB\-window\fR \fBroot\fR and selects the root window.
The option with minus sign replaces the existing selection with
the root window. With a plus sign the root window is added to
an existing selection.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-focus\fR, \fB+f\fR, \fB+focus\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, -focus, +f, +focus"
Is equivalent to \fB\-window\fR \fBfocus\fR and selects the focused window.
The option with minus sign replaces the existing selection with
the focused window. With a plus sign the focused window is added to
an existing selection.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, -all"
Selects all client windows of the window manager.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-shown\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, -shown"
Selects all clients which are on the current workspace.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-top\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t, -top"
Selects all toplevel windows from the display unconditionally.
This includes windows which have never been mapped and windows
with the override redirect bit set to evade management.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xembed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x, -xembed"
Selects all windows which are embedded using the \fI\s-1XEMBED\s0\fR protocol.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-Dockapps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D, -Dockapps"
Selects all Dockapp applications which are managed by icewm.
.SS "\s-1FILTER OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "FILTER OPTIONS"
The following options \fIfilter\fR the currently selected set of windows.
If no previous \fIselect\fR option was given then a \fB\-all\fR option is
implicitly assumed to filter all client windows.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-class\fR \fI\s-1WM_CLASS\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, -class WM_CLASS"
Filters the set of windows on window manager class, \fI\s-1WM_CLASS\s0\fR.  If
\&\fI\s-1WM_CLASS\s0\fR contains a period, only windows with exactly the same
\&\fI\s-1WM_CLASS\s0\fR property are matched.  If there is no period, windows of the
same class and windows of the same instance (aka. \fI\-name\fR) are selected.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-last\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, -last"
Filter clients and keep only the most recent client.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-machine\fR \fI\s-1HOST\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, -machine HOST"
Filters clients by host name. Clients with a \s-1WM_CLIENT_MACHINE\s0 property
equal to \fI\s-1HOST\s0\fR are selected.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-name\fR \fI\s-1NAME\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, -name NAME"
Filters clients by _NET_WM_NAME or \s-1WM_NAME.\s0
\&\fI\s-1NAME\s0\fR matches any part of the property value.
To match at the beginning use a \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR prefix.
To match at the end use a \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR suffix.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-pid\fR \fI\s-1PID\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p, -pid PID"
Filters clients by process \s-1ID.\s0 Clients with a _NET_WM_PID property equal
to \fI\s-1PID\s0\fR are selected.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-unmapped\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, -unmapped"
Filter clients and keep those which are currently not viewable.
These are hidden, minimized, rolled-up, or on another workspace.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-viewable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, -viewable"
Filter clients and keep only those which are currently viewable.
These clients are mapped on the current workspace.
.IP "\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-Gravity\fR \fI\s-1GRAVITY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-G, -Gravity GRAVITY"
Filters clients by the window gravity field of the \s-1WM_NORMAL_HINTS\s0
property.  Clients with a gravity equal to \fI\s-1GRAVITY\s0\fR are selected.
If \fI\s-1GRAVITY\s0\fR starts with an exclamation mark then the filtering is
inverted.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-Layer\fR \fI\s-1LAYER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, -Layer LAYER"
Filters clients by \fI\s-1GNOME\s0 window layer\fR, which can either be a layer
name or a layer number. See \s-1EXPRESSIONS\s0 below. If \fI\s-1LAYER\s0\fR starts with
an exclamation mark then the filtering is inverted.
.IP "\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-Netstate\fR \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-N, -Netstate STATE"
Filters clients by \fI\s-1EWMH\s0 window state\fR. Clients which have at
least an \s-1EWMH\s0 window state of \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR are selected.  This state
refers to details like \fB\s-1MINIZED\s0\fR or \fB\s-1MAXIMIZED\s0\fR. See \s-1EXPRESSIONS\s0
below. If \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR starts with an exclamation mark then the filtering
is inverted.  A question mark \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR filters clients with any bit set
in \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-Property\fR \fIPROP[=value]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, -Property PROP[=value]"
Filters clients by property. Clients which have a property \fI\s-1PROP\s0\fR
are selected. If the optional \fIvalue\fR is given, the match succeeds
only if \fI\s-1PROP\s0\fR is a string, window, cardinal, or atom, with a value
equal to \fIvalue\fR.  The filtering is inverted if \fI\s-1PROP\s0\fR starts with
an exclamation mark.
.IP "\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-Role\fR \fI\s-1ROLE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R, -Role ROLE"
Filters clients by \s-1WM_WINDOW_ROLE.\s0 Clients which have a \s-1WM_WINDOW_ROLE\s0
property value equal to \fI\s-1ROLE\s0\fR are selected.  The filtering is inverted
if \fI\s-1ROLE\s0\fR starts with an exclamation mark.
.IP "\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-Workspace\fR \fI\s-1WORKSPACE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W, -Workspace WORKSPACE"
Filter clients by workspace. Workspace \fI\s-1WORKSPACE\s0\fR is either a
workspace name, or a workspace number counting from zero, or the word
\&\f(CW\*(C`this\*(C'\fR for the current workspace, or the word \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR for all workspaces.
If \fI\s-1WORKSPACE\s0\fR starts with an exclamation mark then the filtering is
inverted.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-Xinerama\fR \fI\s-1MONITOR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X, -Xinerama MONITOR"
Limit clients by \fIRandR\fR/\fIXinerama\fR monitor. Only operate on
clients which are displayed on \fI\s-1MONITOR\s0\fR, where \fI\s-1MONITOR\s0\fR can
be \f(CW\*(C`All\*(C'\fR for all monitors, \f(CW\*(C`this\*(C'\fR for the monitor where the
active window is displayed, or a monitor number starting from zero.
See the output of \f(CW\*(C`randr\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`xinerama\*(C'\fR below.
.SS "\s-1GENERAL OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "GENERAL OPTIONS"
The following options are identical for every IceWM command.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-display\fR \fI\s-1DISPLAY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, -display DISPLAY"

.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Don't complain if no matching windows could be found.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.IX Header "ACTIONS"
\&\fBicesh\fR expects one or more action arguments.  There are two kinds of
actions: \fIwindow actions\fR and \fImanager actions\fR. The first operates on
the selected windows. The second directly interacts with the \fBicewm\fR
window manager.

.IX Item "setGeometry GEOMETRY"
Set the window geometry to \fI\s-1GEOMETRY\s0\fR.  This geometry should be
specified in a format that can be parsed by \fBXParseGeometry\fR\|(3).
Negative offsets are with respect to the bottom or right side of
the screen.  Use \f(CW\*(C`+\-\*(C'\fR for a truly negative position.
.IP "\fBgetGeometry\fR" 4
.IX Item "getGeometry"
Print the window geometry.
.IP "\fBnetState\fR \fI[\s-1STATE\s0]\fR" 4
.IX Item "netState [STATE]"
If \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR is omitted then it shows the \fI\s-1EWMH\s0 window state\fR.
If \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR starts with a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR then flags in \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR are appended to
the existing \fI\s-1EWMH\s0 window state\fR.  If \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR starts with a \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR
then flags in \fI\s-1STATE\s0\fR are removed from the existing \fI\s-1EWMH\s0 window

.SS "\s-1CONDITIONALS\s0"
.IX Subsection "CONDITIONALS"
Icesh supports \f(CW\*(C`if\-then\-else\*(C'\fR expressions. The full syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    if selection
\&    then
\&        actions
\&    elif selection
\&    then
\&        actions
\&    else
\&        actions
\&    end
.Ve
.PP
Where \f(CW\*(C`selection\*(C'\fR is a sequence of selection and filtering options,
which evaluates to \fBtrue\fR when it is non-empty. That is, if one or more
windows fulfilled the condition. If it is empty, then its \f(CW\*(C`actions\*(C'\fR
clause is ignored and the subsequent \f(CW\*(C`elif\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR clause is tried
or taken. Each clause is optional.
.PP
Whenever a selection condition evaluates to \fBfalse\fR, the window selection
that existed before the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR clause is immediately restored.  This also
happens after an \f(CW\*(C`end\*(C'\fR clause.
