.SH NAME
btrfs-scrub \- scrub btrfs filesystem, verify block checksums
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBbtrfs scrub\fP <subcommand> <args>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Scrub is a pass over all filesystem data and metadata and verifying the
checksums. If a valid copy is available (replicated block group profiles) then
the damaged one is repaired. All copies of the replicated profiles are validated.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck) and does not verify nor repair
structural damage in the filesystem. It really only checks checksums of data
and tree blocks, it doesn\(aqt ensure the content of tree blocks is valid and
consistent. There\(aqs some validation performed when metadata blocks are read
from disk but it\(aqs not extensive and cannot substitute full \fIbtrfs check\fP
run.

.sp
The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system service. The
recommended period is a month but could be less. The estimated device bandwidth
utilization is about 80% on an idle filesystem. The IO priority class is by
default \fIidle\fP so background scrub should not significantly interfere with
normal filesystem operation. The IO scheduler set for the device(s) might not
support the priority classes though.
.sp
The scrubbing status is recorded in \fI/var/lib/btrfs/\fP in textual files named
\fIscrub.status.UUID\fP for a filesystem identified by the given UUID. (Progress
state is communicated through a named pipe in file \fIscrub.progress.UUID\fP in the
same directory.) The status file is updated every 5 seconds. A resumed scrub
will continue from the last saved position.
.sp
Scrub can be started only on a mounted filesystem, though it\(aqs possible to
scrub only a selected device. See \fBbtrfs scrub start\fP for more.
.SH SUBCOMMAND
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B cancel <path>|<device>
If a scrub is running on the filesystem identified by \fIpath\fP or
\fIdevice\fP, cancel it.
.sp
If a \fIdevice\fP is specified, the corresponding filesystem is found and
\fBbtrfs scrub cancel\fP behaves as if it was called on that filesystem.
The progress is saved in the status file so \fBbtrfs scrub resume\fP can
continue from the last position.
.TP
.B resume [\-BdqrR] [\-c <ioprio_class> \-n <ioprio_classdata>] <path>|<device>
Resume a cancelled or interrupted scrub on the filesystem identified by
\fIpath\fP or on a given \fIdevice\fP\&. The starting point is read from the
status file if it exists.
.sp
This does not start a new scrub if the last scrub finished successfully.
.sp
\fBOptions\fP
.sp
see \fBscrub start\fP\&.
.TP
.B start [\-BdqrRf] [\-c <ioprio_class> \-n <ioprio_classdata>] <path>|<device>
Start a scrub on all devices of the mounted filesystem identified by
\fIpath\fP or on a single \fIdevice\fP\&. If a scrub is already running, the new
one will not start. A device of an unmounted filesystem cannot be
scrubbed this way.
.sp
Without options, scrub is started as a background process. The
automatic repairs of damaged copies is performed by default for block
group profiles with redundancy.
.sp
The default IO priority of scrub is the idle class. The priority can be
configured similar to the \fBionice(1)\fP syntax using \fI\-c\fP and \fI\-n\fP
options.  Note that not all IO schedulers honor the ionice settings.

.TP
.B  \-B
do not background and print scrub statistics when finished
.TP
.B  \-d
print separate statistics for each device of the filesystem
(\fI\-B\fP only) at the end
.TP
.B  \-r
run in read\-only mode, do not attempt to correct anything, can
be run on a read\-only filesystem
.TP

.TP

set IO priority classdata (see \fBionice(1)\fP manpage)
.TP
.B  \-f
force starting new scrub even if a scrub is already running,
this can useful when scrub status file is damaged and reports a
running scrub although it is not, but should not normally be
necessary
.TP

(deprecated) alias for global \fI\-q\fP option
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B status [options] <path>|<device>
Show status of a running scrub for the filesystem identified by \fIpath\fP
or for the specified \fIdevice\fP\&.
.sp
If no scrub is running, show statistics of the last finished or
cancelled scrub for that filesystem or device.
