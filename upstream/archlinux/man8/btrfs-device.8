.TH "BTRFS-DEVICE" "8" "Aug 16, 2022" "5.19" "BTRFS"
.SH NAME
btrfs-device \- manage devices of btrfs filesystems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBbtrfs device\fP <subcommand> <args>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBbtrfs device\fP command group is used to manage devices of the btrfs filesystems.
.SH DEVICE MANAGEMENT
.SH SUBCOMMAND
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B add [\-Kf] <device> [<device>...] <path>
Add device(s) to the filesystem identified by \fIpath\fP\&.
.sp
If applicable, a whole device discard (TRIM) operation is performed prior to
adding the device. A device with existing filesystem detected by \fBblkid(8)\fP
will prevent device addition and has to be forced. Alternatively the filesystem
can be wiped from the device using eg. the \fBwipefs(8)\fP tool.
.sp
The operation is instant and does not affect existing data. The operation merely
adds the device to the filesystem structures and creates some block groups
headers.
.sp
\fBOptions\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-K|\-\-nodiscard
do not perform discard (TRIM) by default
.TP
.B \-f|\-\-force
force overwrite of existing filesystem on the given disk(s)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B  \-\-enqueue

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B remove [options] <device>|<devid> [<device>|<devid>...] <path>
Remove device(s) from a filesystem identified by <path>
.sp
Device removal must satisfy the profile constraints, otherwise the command
fails. The filesystem must be converted to profile(s) that would allow the
removal. This can typically happen when going down from 2 devices to 1 and
using the RAID1 profile. See the section \fITYPICAL USECASES\fP\&.
.sp
The operation can take long as it needs to move all data from the device.
.sp
It is possible to delete the device that was used to mount the filesystem. The
device entry in the mount table will be replaced by another device name with
the lowest device id.
.sp
If the filesystem is mounted in degraded mode (\fI\-o degraded\fP), special term
\fImissing\fP can be used for \fIdevice\fP\&. In that case, the first device that is
described by the filesystem metadata, but not present at the mount time will be
removed.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
In most cases, there is only one missing device in degraded mode,
otherwise mount fails. If there are two or more devices missing (e.g. possible
in RAID6), you need specify \fImissing\fP as many times as the number of missing
devices to remove all of them.

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B delete <device>|<devid> [<device>|<devid>...] <path>
Alias of remove kept for backward compatibility
.TP
.B replace <command> [options] <path>
Alias of whole command group \fIbtrfs replace\fP for convenience. See \fBbtrfs\-replace(8)\fP\&.
.TP
.B ready <device>
Wait until all devices of a multiple\-device filesystem are scanned and
registered within the kernel module. This is to provide a way for automatic
filesystem mounting tools to wait before the mount can start. The device scan
is only one of the preconditions and the mount can fail for other reasons.
Normal users usually do not need this command and may safely ignore it.
.TP
.B scan [options] [<device> [<device>...]]
Scan devices for a btrfs filesystem and register them with the kernel module.
This allows mounting multiple\-device filesystem by specifying just one from the
whole group.
.sp
If no devices are passed, all block devices that blkid reports to contain btrfs
are scanned.
.sp
The options \fI\-\-all\-devices\fP or \fI\-d\fP can be used as a fallback in case blkid is
not available.  If used, behavior is the same as if no devices are passed.
.sp
The command can be run repeatedly. Devices that have been already registered
remain as such. Reloading the kernel module will drop this information. There\(aqs
an alternative way of mounting multiple\-device filesystem without the need for
prior scanning. See the mount option \fIdevice\fP\&.
.sp
\fBOptions\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-d|\-\-all\-devices
Enumerate and register all devices, use as a fallback in case blkid is not
available.
.TP
.B \-u|\-\-forget
Unregister a given device or all stale devices if no path is given, the device
must be unmounted otherwise it\(aqs an error.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B stats [options] <path>|<device>
Read and print the device IO error statistics for all devices of the given
filesystem identified by \fIpath\fP or for a single \fIdevice>. The filesystem must
be mounted.  See section *DEVICE STATS\fP for more information about the reported
statistics and the meaning.
.sp
\fBOptions\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-z|\-\-reset
Print the stats and reset the values to zero afterwards.
.TP
.B \-c|\-\-check
Check if the stats are all zeros and return 0 if it is so. Set bit 6 of the
return code if any of the statistics is no\-zero. The error values is 65 if
reading stats from at least one device failed, otherwise it\(aqs 64.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B  \-T
Print stats in a tabular form, devices as rows and stats as columns
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B usage [options] <path> [<path>...]::
Show detailed information about internal allocations on devices.
.sp
The level of detail can differ if the command is run under a regular or the
root user (due to use of restricted ioctls). The first example below is for
normal user (warning included) and the next one with root on the same
filesystem:

Failed writes to the block devices, means that the layers beneath the

Read request analogy to write_io_errs.
.TP
.B flush_io_errs
Number of failed writes with the \fIFLUSH\fP flag set. The flushing is a method of
forcing a particular order between write requests and is crucial for
implementing crash consistency. In case of btrfs, all the metadata blocks must
be permanently stored on the block device before the superblock is written.

A block checksum mismatched or a corrupted metadata header was found.
.TP
.B generation_errs
The block generation does not match the expected value (eg. stored in the
parent node).

Since kernel 5.14 the device stats are also available in textual form in
\fI/sys/fs/btrfs/FSID/devinfo/DEVID/error_stats\fP\&.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
\fBbtrfs device\fP returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is
returned in case of failure.
.sp
If the \fI\-c\fP option is used, \fIbtrfs device stats\fP will add 64 to the
exit status if any of the error counters is non\-zero.
.SH AVAILABILITY
.sp
\fBbtrfs\fP is part of btrfs\-progs.
