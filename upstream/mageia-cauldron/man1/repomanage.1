.TH "REPOMANAGE" "1" "Sep 26, 2022" "4.3.1" "dnf-plugins-core"
.SH NAME
repomanage \- redirecting to DNF repomanage Plugin
.sp
Manage a repository or a simple directory of rpm packages.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdnf repomanage [<optional\-options>] [<options>] <path>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fIrepomanage\fP prints newest or older packages in a repository specified by <path> for easy piping to xargs or similar programs. In case <path> doesn\(aqt contain a valid repodata, it is searched for rpm packages which are then used instead.
If the repodata are present, \fIrepomanage\fP uses them as the source of truth, it doesn\(aqt verify that they match the present rpm packages. In fact, \fIrepomanage\fP can run with just the repodata, no rpm packages are needed.
.sp
In order to work correctly with modular packages, <path> has to contain repodata with modular metadata. If modular content is present, \fIrepomanage\fP prints packages from newest or older stream versions in addition to newest or older non\-modular packages.
.SS Options
.sp
All general DNF options are accepted, see \fIOptions\fP in \fBdnf(8)\fP for details.
.sp
The following options set what packages are displayed. These options are mutually exclusive, i.e. only one can be specified. If no option is specified, the newest packages are shown.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-old\fP
Show older packages (for a package or a stream show all versions except the newest one).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-oldonly\fP
Show older packages (same as \-\-old, but exclude the newest packages even when it\(aqs included in the older stream versions).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-new\fP
Show newest packages.
.UNINDENT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0

.B \fB\-k <keep\-number>\fP, \fB\-\-keep <keep\-number>\fP
