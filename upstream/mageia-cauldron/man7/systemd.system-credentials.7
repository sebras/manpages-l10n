.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\m[blue]\fBSystem and Service Credentials\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
are data objects that may be passed into booted systems or system services as they are invoked\&. They can be acquired from various external sources, and propagated into the system and from there into system services\&. Credentials may optionally be encrypted with a machine\-specific key and/or locked to the local TPM2 device, and are only decrypted when the consuming service is invoked\&.
.PP
System credentials may be used to provision and configure various aspects of the system\&. Depending on the consuming component credentials are only used on initial invocations or are needed for all invocations\&.
.PP
Credentials may be used for any kind of data, binary or text, and may carry passwords, secrets, certificates, cryptographic key material, identity information, configuration, and more\&.
