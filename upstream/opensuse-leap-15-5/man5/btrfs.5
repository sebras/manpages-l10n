.SH "MOUNT OPTIONS"

This section describes mount options specific to BTRFS\&. For the generic mount options please refer to \fBmount\fR(8) manpage\&. The options are sorted alphabetically (discarding the \fIno\fR prefix)\&.

.sp
most mount options apply to the whole filesystem and only options in the first mounted subvolume will take effect\&. This is due to lack of implementation and may change in the future\&. This means that (for example) you can\(cqt set per\-subvolume \fInodatacow\fR, \fInodatasum\fR, or \fIcompress\fR using mount options\&. This should eventually be fixed, but it has proved to be difficult to implement correctly within the Linux VFS framework\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
Mount options are processed in order, only the last occurrence of an option takes effect and may disable other options due to constraints (see eg\&. \fInodatacow\fR and \fIcompress\fR)\&. The output of \fImount\fR command shows which options have been applied\&.

.sp
Enable/disable support for Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs)\&. See the
\fBacl\fR(5) manual page for more information about ACLs\&.
.sp
The support for ACL is build\-time configurable (BTRFS_FS_POSIX_ACL) and mount fails if
\fIacl\fR
is requested but the feature is not compiled in\&.

Enable automatic file defragmentation\&. When enabled, small random writes into files (in a range of tens of kilobytes, currently it\(cqs 64K) are detected and queued up for the defragmentation process\&. Not well suited for large database workloads\&.
.sp
The read latency may increase due to reading the adjacent blocks that make up the range for defragmentation, successive write will merge the blocks in the new location\&.

\fBbarrier\fR, \fBnobarrier\fR
.RS 4
(default: on)
.sp
Ensure that all IO write operations make it through the device cache and are stored permanently when the filesystem is at its consistency checkpoint\&. This typically means that a flush command is sent to the device that will synchronize all pending data and ordinary metadata blocks, then writes the superblock and issues another flush\&.
.sp
The write flushes incur a slight hit and also prevent the IO block scheduler to reorder requests in a more effective way\&. Disabling barriers gets rid of that penalty but will most certainly lead to a corrupted filesystem in case of a crash or power loss\&. The ordinary metadata blocks could be yet unwritten at the time the new superblock is stored permanently, expecting that the block pointers to metadata were stored permanently before\&.
.sp
On a device with a volatile battery\-backed write\-back cache, the
\fInobarrier\fR
option will not lead to filesystem corruption as the pending blocks are supposed to make it to the permanent storage\&.

.sp
These debugging options control the behavior of the integrity checking module (the BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY config option required)\&. The main goal is to verify that all blocks from a given transaction period are properly linked\&.
.sp
\fIcheck_int\fR
enables the integrity checker module, which examines all block write requests to ensure on\-disk consistency, at a large memory and CPU cost\&.
.sp
\fIcheck_int_data\fR
includes extent data in the integrity checks, and implies the
\fIcheck_int\fR
option\&.
.sp
\fIcheck_int_print_mask\fR
takes a bitmask of BTRFSIC_PRINT_MASK_* values as defined in
\fIfs/btrfs/check\-integrity\&.c\fR, to control the integrity checker module behavior\&.

\fBcommit=\fR\fB\fIseconds\fR\fR
.RS 4
(since: 3\&.12, default: 30)
.sp
Set the interval of periodic transaction commit when data are synchronized to permanent storage\&. Higher interval values lead to larger amount of unwritten data, which has obvious consequences when the system crashes\&. The upper bound is not forced, but a warning is printed if it\(cqs more than 300 seconds (5 minutes)\&. Use with care\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcompress\fR, \fBcompress=\fR\fB\fItype[:level]\fR\fR, \fBcompress\-force\fR, \fBcompress\-force=\fR\fB\fItype[:level]\fR\fR
.RS 4
(default: off, level support since: 5\&.1)
.sp
Control BTRFS file data compression\&. Type may be specified as
\fIzlib\fR,
\fIlzo\fR,
\fIzstd\fR
or
\fIno\fR
(for no compression, used for remounting)\&. If no type is specified,
\fIzlib\fR
is used\&. If
\fIcompress\-force\fR
is specified, then compression will always be attempted, but the data may end up uncompressed if the compression would make them larger\&.
.sp
Both
\fIzlib\fR
and
\fIzstd\fR
(since version 5\&.1) expose the compression level as a tunable knob with higher levels trading speed and memory (\fIzstd\fR) for higher compression ratios\&. This can be set by appending a colon and the desired level\&. Zlib accepts the range [1, 9] and zstd accepts [1, 15]\&. If no level is set, both currently use a default level of 3\&. The value 0 is an alias for the default level\&.
.sp
Otherwise some simple heuristics are applied to detect an incompressible file\&. If the first blocks written to a file are not compressible, the whole file is permanently marked to skip compression\&. As this is too simple, the
\fIcompress\-force\fR
is a workaround that will compress most of the files at the cost of some wasted CPU cycles on failed attempts\&. Since kernel 4\&.15, a set of heuristic algorithms have been improved by using frequency sampling, repeated pattern detection and Shannon entropy calculation to avoid that\&.

There is a slight performance gain when checksums are turned off, the corresponding metadata blocks holding the checksums do not need to updated\&. The cost of checksumming of the blocks in memory is much lower than the IO, modern CPUs feature hardware support of the checksumming algorithm\&.

Allow mounts with less devices than the RAID profile constraints require\&. A read\-write mount (or remount) may fail when there are too many devices missing, for example if a stripe member is completely missing from RAID0\&.
.sp
Since 4\&.14, the constraint checks have been improved and are verified on the chunk level, not an the device level\&. This allows degraded mounts of filesystems with mixed RAID profiles for data and metadata, even if the device number constraints would not be satisfied for some of the profiles\&.
.sp
Example: metadata \(em raid1, data \(em single, devices \(em /dev/sda, /dev/sdb
.sp
Suppose the data are completely stored on
\fIsda\fR, then missing
\fIsdb\fR
will not prevent the mount, even if 1 missing device would normally prevent (any)
\fIsingle\fR
profile to mount\&. In case some of the data chunks are stored on
\fIsdb\fR, then the constraint of single/data is not satisfied and the filesystem cannot be mounted\&.

(default: off, async support since: 5\&.6)
.sp
Enable discarding of freed file blocks\&. This is useful for SSD devices, thinly provisioned LUNs, or virtual machine images; however, every storage layer must support discard for it to work\&.
.sp
In the synchronous mode (\fIsync\fR
or without option value), lack of asynchronous queued TRIM on the backing device TRIM can severely degrade performance, because a synchronous TRIM operation will be attempted instead\&. Queued TRIM requires newer than SATA revision 3\&.1 chipsets and devices\&.
.sp
The asynchronous mode (\fIasync\fR) gathers extents in larger chunks before sending them to the devices for TRIM\&. The overhead and performance impact should be negligible compared to the previous mode and it\(cqs supposed to be the preferred mode if needed\&.
.sp
If it is not necessary to immediately discard freed blocks, then the
\fBfstrim\fR
tool can be used to discard all free blocks in a batch\&. Scheduling a TRIM during a period of low system activity will prevent latent interference with the performance of other operations\&. Also, a device may ignore the TRIM command if the range is too small, so running a batch discard has a greater probability of actually discarding the blocks\&.

This makes the committed state a fully consistent view of the file system from the application\(cqs perspective (i\&.e\&. it includes all completed file system operations)\&. This was previously the behavior only when a snapshot was created\&.

Options to control the free space cache\&. The free space cache greatly improves performance when reading block group free space into memory\&. However, managing the space cache consumes some resources, including a small amount of disk space\&.
.sp
There are two implementations of the free space cache\&. The original one, referred to as
\fIv1\fR, is the safe default\&. The
\fIv1\fR
space cache can be disabled at mount time with
\fInospace_cache\fR
without clearing\&.
.sp
On very large filesystems (many terabytes) and certain workloads, the performance of the
\fIv1\fR
space cache may degrade drastically\&. The
\fIv2\fR
implementation, which adds a new B\-tree called the free space tree, addresses this issue\&. Once enabled, the
\fIv2\fR
space cache will always be used and cannot be disabled unless it is cleared\&. Use
\fIclear_cache,space_cache=v1\fR

Since 4\&.14, the block layout optimizations have been dropped\&. This used to help with first generations of SSD devices\&. Their FTL (flash translation layer) was not effective and the optimization was supposed to improve the wear by better aligning blocks\&. This is no longer true with modern SSD devices and the optimization had no real benefit\&. Furthermore it caused increased fragmentation\&. The layout tuning has been kept intact for the option

.sp
Btrfs supports transparent file compression\&. There are three algorithms available: ZLIB, LZO and ZSTD (since v4\&.14)\&. Basically, compression is on a file by file basis\&. You can have a single btrfs mount point that has some files that are uncompressed, some that are compressed with LZO, some with ZLIB, for instance (though you may not want it that way, it is supported)\&.
.sp
To enable compression, mount the filesystem with options \fIcompress\fR or \fIcompress\-force\fR\&. Please refer to section \fIMOUNT OPTIONS\fR\&. Once compression is enabled, all new writes will be subject to compression\&. Some files may not compress very well, and these are typically not recompressed but still written uncompressed\&.
.sp
Each compression algorithm has different speed/ratio trade offs\&. The levels can be selected by a mount option and affect only the resulting size (ie\&. no compatibility issues)\&.

The differences depend on the actual data set and cannot be expressed by a single number or recommendation\&. Higher levels consume more CPU time and may not bring a significant improvement, lower levels are close to real time\&.
.sp
The algorithms could be mixed in one file as they\(cqre stored per extent\&. The compression can be changed on a file by \fBbtrfs filesystem defrag\fR command, using the \fI\-c\fR option, or by \fBbtrfs property set\fR using the \fIcompression\fR property\&. Setting compression by \fIchattr +c\fR utility will set it to zlib\&.
.SS "INCOMPRESSIBLE DATA"
.sp
Files with already compressed data or with data that won\(cqt compress well with the CPU and memory constraints of the kernel implementations are using a simple decision logic\&. If the first portion of data being compressed is not smaller than the original, the compression of the file is disabled \(em unless the filesystem is mounted with \fIcompress\-force\fR\&. In that case compression will always be attempted on the file only to be later discarded\&. This is not optimal and subject to optimizations and further development\&.
.sp
If a file is identified as incompressible, a flag is set (NOCOMPRESS) and it\(cqs sticky\&. On that file compression won\(cqt be performed unless forced\&. The flag can be also set by \fIchattr +m\fR (since e2fsprogs 1\&.46\&.2) or by properties with value \fIno\fR or \fInone\fR\&. Empty value will reset it to the default that\(cqs currently applicable on the mounted filesystem\&.

.RE
.SS "PRE\-COMPRESSION HEURISTICS"
.sp
The heuristics aim to do a few quick statistical tests on the compressed data in order to avoid probably costly compression that would turn out to be inefficient\&. Compression algorithms could have internal detection of incompressible data too but this leads to more overhead as the compression is done in another thread and has to write the data anyway\&. The heuristic is read\-only and can utilize cached memory\&.
.sp
The tests performed based on the following: data sampling, long repated pattern detection, byte frequency, Shannon entropy\&.

.SS "SUPER BLOCK"

As said above, super block is handled in a special way\&. In order to be crash safe, at least one zone in a known location must contain a valid superblock\&. This is implemented as a ring buffer in two consecutive zones, starting from known offsets 0, 512G and 4TiB\&. The values are different than on non\-zoned devices\&. Each new super block is appended to the end of the zone, once it\(cqs filled, the zone is reset and writes continue to the next one\&. Looking up the latest super block needs to read offsets of both zones and determine the last written version\&.
.sp
The amount of space reserved for super block depends on the zone size\&. The secondary and tertiary copies are at distant offsets as the capacity of the devices is expected to be large, tens of terabytes\&. Maximum zone size supported is 8GiB, which would mean that eg\&. offset 0\-16GiB would be reserved just for the super block on a hypothetical device of that zone size\&.

.SH "SEEDING DEVICE"
.sp
The COW mechanism and multiple devices under one hood enable an interesting concept, called a seeding device: extending a read\-only filesystem on a single device filesystem with another device that captures all writes\&. For example imagine an immutable golden image of an operating system enhanced with another device that allows to use the data from the golden image and normal operation\&. This idea originated on CD\-ROMs with base OS and allowing to use them for live systems, but this became obsolete\&. There are technologies providing similar functionality, like \fIunionmount\fR, \fIoverlayfs\fR or \fIqcow2\fR image snapshot\&.
.sp
The seeding device starts as a normal filesystem, once the contents is ready, \fBbtrfstune \-S 1\fR is used to flag it as a seeding device\&. Mounting such device will not allow any writes, except adding a new device by \fBbtrfs device add\fR\&. Then the filesystem can be remounted as read\-write\&.
.sp
Given that the filesystem on the seeding device is always recognized as read\-only, it can be used to seed multiple filesystems, at the same time\&. The UUID that is normally attached to a device is automatically changed to a random UUID on each mount\&.
.sp
Once the seeding device is mounted, it needs the writable device\&. After adding it, something like \fIremount \-o remount,rw /path\fR makes the filesystem at \fI/path\fR ready for use\&. The simplest usecase is to throw away all changes by unmounting the filesystem when convenient\&.
.sp
Alternatively, deleting the seeding device from the filesystem can turn it into a normal filesystem, provided that the writable device can also contain all the data from the seeding device\&.
.sp
The seeding device flag can be cleared again by \fBbtrfstune \-f \-s 0\fR, eg\&. allowing to update with newer data but please note that this will invalidate all existing filesystems that use this particular seeding device\&. This works for some usecases, not for others, and a forcing flag to the command is mandatory to avoid accidental mistakes\&.
.sp
Example how to create and use one seeding device:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# mkfs\&.btrfs /dev/sda
# mount /dev/sda /mnt/mnt1
# \&.\&.\&. fill mnt1 with data

# mount /dev/sda /mnt/mnt1
# btrfs device add /dev/sdb /mnt
# mount \-o remount,rw /mnt/mnt1
# \&.\&.\&. /mnt/mnt1 is now writable
.fi
.if n \{\

.\}
.nf

.SH "RAID56 STATUS AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES"
.sp
The RAID56 feature provides striping and parity over several devices, same as the traditional RAID5/6\&. There are some implementation and design deficiencies that make it unreliable for some corner cases and the feature \fBshould not be used in production, only for evaluation or testing\fR\&. The power failure safety for metadata with RAID56 is not 100%\&.
.SS "Metadata"
.sp
Do not use \fIraid5\fR nor \fIraid6\fR for metadata\&. Use \fIraid1\fR or \fIraid1c3\fR respectively\&.
.sp
The substitute profiles provide the same guarantees against loss of 1 or 2 devices, and in some respect can be an improvement\&. Recovering from one missing device will only need to access the remaining 1st or 2nd copy, that in general may be stored on some other devices due to the way RAID1 works on btrfs, unlike on a striped profile (similar to \fIraid0\fR) that would need all devices all the time\&.
.sp
The space allocation pattern and consumption is different (eg\&. on N devices): for \fIraid5\fR as an example, a 1GiB chunk is reserved on each device, while with \fIraid1\fR there\(cqs each 1GiB chunk stored on 2 devices\&. The consumption of each 1GiB of used metadata is then \fIN * 1GiB\fR for vs \fI2 * 1GiB\fR\&. Using \fIraid1\fR is also more convenient for balancing/converting to other profile due to lower requirement on the available chunk space\&.

When RAID56 is on the same filesystem with different raid profiles, the space reporting is inaccurate, eg\&. \fIdf\fR, \fIbtrfs filesystem df\fR or \fIbtrfs filesystem usge\fR\&. When there\(cqs only a one profile per block group type (eg\&. raid5 for data) the reporting is accurate\&.

.SH "STORAGE MODEL"
.sp
\fIA storage model is a model that captures key physical aspects of data structure in a data store\&. A filesystem is the logical structure organizing data on top of the storage device\&.\fR
.sp
The filesystem assumes several features or limitations of the storage device and utilizes them or applies measures to guarantee reliability\&. BTRFS in particular is based on a COW (copy on write) mode of writing, ie\&. not updating data in place but rather writing a new copy to a different location and then atomically switching the pointers\&.
.sp
In an ideal world, the device does what it promises\&. The filesystem assumes that this may not be true so additional mechanisms are applied to either detect misbehaving hardware or get valid data by other means\&. The devices may (and do) apply their own detection and repair mechanisms but we won\(cqt assume any\&.

The consistency model of BTRFS builds on these assumptions\&.

\fBThe flush command does not flush (2)\fR
.sp
This is perhaps the most serious problem and impossible to mitigate by filesystem without limitations and design restrictions\&. What could happen in the worst case is that writes from one generation bleed to another one, while still letting the filesystem consider the generations isolated\&. Crash at any point would leave data on the device in an inconsistent state without any hint what exactly got written, what is missing and leading to stale metadata link information\&.
.sp
Devices usually honor the flush command, but for performance reasons may do internal caching, where the flushed data are not yet persistently stored\&. A power failure could lead to a similar scenario as above, although it\(cqs less likely that later writes would be written before the cached ones\&. This is beyond what a filesystem can take into account\&. Devices or controllers are usually equipped with batteries or capacitors to write the cache contents even after power is cut\&.

This would be another serious problem as the filesystem has no information when it happens\&. For that reason the measures have to be done ahead of time\&. This problem is also commonly called \fIghost write\fR\&.
.sp
The metadata blocks have the checksum embedded in the blocks, so a correct atomic write would not corrupt the checksum\&. It\(cqs likely that after reading such block the data inside would not be consistent with the rest\&. To rule that out there\(cqs embedded block number in the metadata block\&. It\(cqs the logical block number because this is what the logical structure expects and verifies\&.

The following is based on information publicly available, user feedback, community discussions or bug report analyses\&. It\(cqs not complete and further research is encouraged when in doubt\&.
.SS "MAIN MEMORY"
.sp
The data structures and raw data blocks are temporarily stored in computer memory before they get written to the device\&. It is critical that memory is reliable because even simple bit flips can have vast consequences and lead to damaged structures, not only in the filesystem but in the whole operating system\&.
.sp
Based on experience in the community, memory bit flips are more common than one would think\&. When it happens, it\(cqs reported by the tree\-checker or by a checksum mismatch after reading blocks\&. There are some very obvious instances of bit flips that happen, e\&.g\&. in an ordered sequence of keys in metadata blocks\&. We can easily infer from the other data what values get damaged and how\&. However, fixing that is not straightforward and would require cross\-referencing data from the entire filesystem to see the scope\&.
.sp
If available, ECC memory should lower the chances of bit flips, but this type of memory is not available in all cases\&. A memory test should be performed in case there\(cqs a visible bit flip pattern, though this may not detect a faulty memory module because the actual load of the system could be the factor making the problems appear\&. In recent years attacks on how the memory modules operate have been demonstrated (\fIrowhammer\fR) achieving specific bits to be flipped\&. While these were targeted, this shows that a series of reads or writes can affect unrelated parts of memory\&.

.SS "SOLID STATE DRIVES (SSD)"
.sp
The mechanism of information storage is different from HDDs and this affects the failure mode as well\&. The data are stored in cells grouped in large blocks with limited number of resets and other write constraints\&. The firmware tries to avoid unnecessary resets and performs optimizations to maximize the storage media lifetime\&. The known techniques are deduplication (blocks with same fingerprint/hash are mapped to same physical block), compression or internal remapping and garbage collection of used memory cells\&. Due to the additional processing there are measures to verity the data e\&.g\&. by ECC codes\&.
.sp
The observations of failing SSDs show that the whole electronic fails at once or affects a lot of data (eg\&. stored on one chip)\&. Recovering such data may need specialized equipment and reading data repeatedly does not help as it\(cqs possible with HDDs\&.

There are several technologies of the memory cells with different characteristics and price\&. The lifetime is directly affected by the type and frequency of data written\&.

SSD firmware often adds its own write multipliers that can be arbitrary and unpredictable and dependent on application behavior, and these will typically have far greater effect on SSD lifespan than DUP metadata\&. It\(cqs more or less impossible to predict when a SSD will run out of lifetime writes to within a factor of two, so it\(cqs hard to justify wear reduction as a benefit\&.
