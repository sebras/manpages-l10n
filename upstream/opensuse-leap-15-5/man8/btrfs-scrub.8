.SH "NAME"
btrfs-scrub \- scrub btrfs filesystem, verify block checksums
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBbtrfs scrub\fR \fI<subcommand>\fR \fI<args>\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBbtrfs scrub\fR is used to scrub a mounted btrfs filesystem, which will read all data and metadata blocks from all devices and verify checksums\&. Automatically repair corrupted blocks if there\(cqs a correct copy available\&.

.sp
Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck) and does not verify nor repair structural damage in the filesystem\&. It really only checks checksums of data and tree blocks, it doesn\(cqt ensure the content of tree blocks is valid and consistent\&. There\(cqs some validation performed when metadata blocks are read from disk but it\(cqs not extensive and cannot substitute full \fIbtrfs check\fR run\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system service\&. The recommended period is a month but could be less\&. The estimated device bandwidth utilization is about 80% on an idle filesystem\&. The IO priority class is by default \fIidle\fR so background scrub should not significantly interfere with normal filesystem operation\&. The IO scheduler set for the device(s) might not support the priority classes though\&.
.sp
The scrubbing status is recorded in \fI/var/lib/btrfs/\fR in textual files named \fIscrub\&.status\&.UUID\fR for a filesystem identified by the given UUID\&. (Progress state is communicated through a named pipe in file \fIscrub\&.progress\&.UUID\fR in the same directory\&.) The status file is updated every 5 seconds\&. A resumed scrub will continue from the last saved position\&.
.sp
Scrub can be started only on a mounted filesystem, though it\(cqs possible to scrub only a selected device\&. See \fBscrub start\fR for more\&.
.SH "SUBCOMMAND"
.PP
\fBcancel\fR \fI<path>\fR|\fI<device>\fR
.RS 4
If a scrub is running on the filesystem identified by
\fIpath\fR
or
\fIdevice\fR, cancel it\&.
.sp
If a
\fIdevice\fR
is specified, the corresponding filesystem is found and
\fBbtrfs scrub cancel\fR
behaves as if it was called on that filesystem\&. The progress is saved in the status file so
\fBbtrfs scrub resume\fR
can continue from the last position\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBresume\fR [\-BdqrR] [\-c \fI<ioprio_class>\fR \-n \fI<ioprio_classdata>\fR] \fI<path>\fR|\fI<device>\fR
.RS 4
Resume a cancelled or interrupted scrub on the filesystem identified by
\fIpath\fR
or on a given
\fIdevice\fR\&. The starting point is read from the status file if it exists\&.
.sp
This does not start a new scrub if the last scrub finished successfully\&.

\fBscrub start\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstart\fR [\-BdqrRf] [\-c \fI<ioprio_class>\fR \-n \fI<ioprio_classdata>\fR] \fI<path>\fR|\fI<device>\fR
.RS 4
Start a scrub on all devices of the mounted filesystem identified by
\fIpath\fR
or on a single
\fIdevice\fR\&. If a scrub is already running, the new one will not start\&. A device of an unmounted filesystem cannot be scrubbed this way\&.
.sp
Without options, scrub is started as a background process\&. The automatic repairs of damaged copies is performed by default for block group profiles with redundancy\&.
.sp
The default IO priority of scrub is the idle class\&. The priority can be configured similar to the
\fBionice\fR(1) syntax using
\fI\-c\fR
and
\fI\-n\fR
options\&. Note that not all IO schedulers honor the ionice settings\&.
