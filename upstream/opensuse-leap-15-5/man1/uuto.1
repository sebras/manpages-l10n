.SH NAME
uuto \- send files to a user on another system.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uuto
.I files... system!user
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBuuto\fR program may be used to conveniently send files to a
particular user on a remote system. It will arrange for mail to be sent
to the remote user when the files arrive on the remote system, and he or
she may easily retrieve the files using the
.BR uupick (1)
program. Note that \fBuuto\fR does not provide any
security \-\- any user on the remote system can examine the files.
.LP
The last argument specifies the system and user name to which to send
the files. The other arguments are the files or directories to be sent.
.LP
The \fBuuto\fR program is actually just a trivial shell script which
invokes the \fBuucp\fR program with the appropriate arguments. Any option
which may be given to \fBuucp\fR may also be given to \fBuuto\fR, see
.BR uucp (1).
