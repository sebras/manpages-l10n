.SH SYNOPSIS
\f\*[B-Font]shar\fP
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
[\f\*[B-Font]\-flags\f[]]

If no \fIfile\fPs are specified, the list of input files is read
from standard input.  Standard input must not be a terminal.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBshar\fP creates "shell archives" (or shar files) which are in
text format and can be emailed.  These files may be unpacked later by
executing them with \fI/bin/sh\fP.  The resulting archive is sent to
standard out unless the \fB-o\fP option is given.  A wide range of
features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing shars and in
specifying \fBshar\fP "smartness".  Archives may be fairly simple
(\fB--vanilla-operation\fP) or essentially a mailable \fBtar\fP
archive.
.sp
Options may be specified in any order until a \fBfile\fP argument is
recognized.  If the \fB--intermix-type\fP option has been specified,
more compression and encoding options will be recognized between the
\fIfile\fP arguments.
.sp
Though this program supports \fBuuencode\fP-d files, they
are deprecated.  If you are emailing files, please consider
mime-encoded files.  If you do \fBuuencode\fP, base64 is the
preferred encoding method.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Specifying compression"
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-p\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-intermix\-type\f[]
specify compression for input files.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
vanilla-operation.
.sp
Allow positional parameter options.  The compression method and
encoding method options may be intermixed with file names.
Files named after these options will be processed in the specified way.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-C\f[] \f\*[I-Font]program\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-compactor\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]program\f[]
specify compaction (compression) program.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
vanilla-operation.
.sp
The \fBgzip\fP, \fBbzip2\fP and \fBcompress\fP compactor
commands may be specified by the program name as the option name,
e.g. \fB--gzip\fP.  Those options, however, are being deprecated.
There is also the \fBxz\fP compactor now.  Specify \fBxz\fP
with \fB-C xz\fP or \fB--compactor=xz\fP.
.sp
        Specifying the compactor "\fBnone\fP" will disable file compression.
Compressed files are never processed as plain text.  They are always
uuencoded and the recipient must have \fBuudecode\fP to unpack
them.
.sp
Specifying the compactor \fBcompress\fP is deprecated.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-g\f[] \f\*[I-Font]level\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-level\-of\-compression\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]level\f[]
pass \fILEVEL\fP for compression.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]level\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  1 through 9
.fi
.in -4
The default
\f\*[I-Font]level\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 9
.sp
Some compression programs allow for a level of compression.  The
default is \fB9\fP, but this option allows you to specify something
else.  This value is used by \fBgzip\fP, \fBbzip2\fP and
\fBxz\fP, but not \fBcompress\fP.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-j\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-bzip2\f[]
\fBbzip2\fP and \fBuuencode\fP files.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.

\fBbzip2\fP compress and \fBuuencode\fP all files
prior to packing.  The recipient must have \fBuudecode\fP
\fBbzip2\fP in order to unpack.
.sp

\fBgzip\fP compress and \fBuuencode\fP all files prior
to packing.  The recipient must have \fBuudecode\fP and
\fBgzip\fP in order to unpack.
.sp
.B
NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-Z\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-compress\f[]
\fBcompress\fP and \fBuuencode\fP files.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.

\fBcompress\fP and \fBuuencode\fP all files prior to
packing.  The recipient must have \fBuudecode\fP and
\fBcompress\fP in order to unpack.

.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-b\f[] \f\*[I-Font]bits\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-bits\-per\-code\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]bits\f[]
pass \fIbits\fP (default 12) to compress.
The default
\f\*[I-Font]bits\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 12
.sp
This is the compression factor used by the \fBcompress\fP program.
.sp
.B
NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED
.SS "Specifying file encoding methodology"
Files may be stored in the shar either as plain text or uuencoded.
By default, the program selects which by examining the file.
You may force the selection for all files.  In intermixed option/file
mode, this setting may be changed during processing.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-M\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-mixed\-uuencode\f[]
decide uuencoding for each file.
This option is a member of the mixed-uuencode class of options.
.sp
Automatically determine if the files are text or binary and archive
correctly.  Files found to be binary are uuencoded prior to packing.
This is the default behavior for \fBshar\fP.
.sp
For a file to be considered a text file instead of a binary file,
all the following should be true:
.sp 1
The file does not contain any ASCII control character besides \fIBS\fP
(backspace), \fIHT\fP (horizontal tab), \fILF\fP (new line) or
\fIFF\fP (form feed).
.sp 1
The file contains no character with its eighth-bit set.
.sp 1
The file contains no line beginning with the five letters
"\fBfrom \fP", capitalized or not.  (Mail handling programs
will often gratuitously insert a \fB>\fP character before it.)
.sp 1
The file is either empty or ends with a \fILF\fP (newline) byte.
.sp 1
No line in the file contains more than 200 characters.  For counting
purpose, lines are separated by a \fILF\fP (newline).
.br
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-B\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-uuencode\f[]
treat all files as binary.
This option is a member of the mixed-uuencode class of options.
.sp
Use \fBuuencode\fP prior to packing all files.  This
increases the size of the archive.  The recipient must have
\fBuudecode\fP in order to unpack.  Compressed files are
always encoded.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-T\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-text\-files\f[]
treat all files as text.
This option is a member of the mixed-uuencode class of options.
.sp
If you have files with non-ascii bytes or text that some mail handling
programs do not like, you may find difficulties.  However, if you are
using FTP or SSH/SCP, the non-conforming text files should be okay.
.SS "Specifying file selection and output modes"
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-o\f[] \f\*[I-Font]prefix\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-output\-prefix\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]prefix\f[]
print output to file PREFIX.nn.
.sp
Save the archive to files \fIprefix.01\fP thru \fIprefix.nn\fP
instead of sending all output to standard out.  Must be specified when
the \fB--whole-size-limit\fP or \fB--split-size-limit\fP
options are specified.
.sp
When \fBprefix\fP contains a \fB%\fP character, \fBprefix\fP is then
interpreted as a \fBsprintf\fP format, which should be able to display
a single decimal number.  When \fBprefix\fP does not contain such a
\fB%\fP character, the string \fB.%02d\fP is internally appended.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-l\f[] \f\*[I-Font]size\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-whole\-size\-limit\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]size\f[]
split archive, not files, to \fIsize\fP.
This option is a member of the whole-size-limit class of options.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
output-prefix.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]size\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  8 through 1023, or
in the range  8192 through 4194304
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Limit the output file size to \fIsize\fP bytes, but don't split input
files.  If \fIsize\fP is less than 1024, then it will be multiplied
by 1024.  The value may also be specified with a k, K, m or M suffix.
The number is then multiplied by 1000, 1024, 1000000, or 1048576,
respectively.  4M (4194304) is the maximum allowed.
.sp
Unlike the \fBsplit-size-limit\fP option, this allows the recipient
of the shar files to unpack them in any order.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-L\f[] \f\*[I-Font]size\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-split\-size\-limit\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]size\f[]
split archive or files to \fIsize\fP.
This option is a member of the whole-size-limit class of options.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
output-prefix.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of
\f\*[I-Font]size\f[]
is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  8 through 1023, or
in the range  8192 through 4194304
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Limit output file size to \fIsize\fP bytes, splitting files if
necessary.  The allowed values are specified as with the
\fB--whole-size-limit\fP option.
.sp
The archive parts created with this option must be unpacked in the
correct order.  If the recipient of the shell archives wants to put
all of them in a single email folder (file), they will have to be
saved in the correct order for \fBunshar\fP to unpack them all at
once (using one of the split archive options).
see: unshar Invocation.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-I\f[] \f\*[I-Font]file\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-input\-file\-list\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]file\f[]
read file list from a file.
.sp
This option causes \fIfile\fP to be reopened as standard input.  If
no files are found on the input line, then standard input is read for
input file names.  Use of this option will prohibit input files from
being listed on the command line.
.sp
Input must be in a form similar to that generated by \fBfind\fP,
one filename per line.  This switch is especially useful when the
command line will not hold the list of files to be archived.
.sp
If the \fB--intermix-type\fP option is specified on the command
line, then the compression options may be included in the standard
input on lines by themselves and no file name may begin with a hyphen.
.sp
For example:
.nf
    { echo \--compact xz
       find . \-type f \-print | sort
    } | shar \-S \-p \-L50K \-o /somewhere/big
.fi
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-S\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-stdin\-file\-list\f[]
read file list from standard input.
.sp
This option is actually a no-op.  It is a wrapper for
\fB--input-file-list=-\fP.
.sp
.B
NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED
.SS "Controlling the shar headers"
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-n\f[] \f\*[I-Font]name\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-archive\-name\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]name\f[]
use \fIname\fP to document the archive.
.sp
Name of archive to be included in the subject header of the shar
files.  See the \fB--net-headers\fP option.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-s\f[] \f\*[I-Font]who@where\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-submitter\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]who@where\f[]
override the submitter name.
.sp
\fBshar\fP will normally determine the submitter name by querying
the system.  Use this option if it is being done on behalf of another.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-a\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-net\-headers\f[]
output Submitted-by: & Archive-name: headers.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
archive-name.
.sp
Adds specialized email headers:
.nf
    Submitted-by: \fIwho@@where\fP
    Archive-name: \fIname\fP/part##
.fi
The \fIwho@@where\fP is normally derived, but can be specified with the
\fB--submitter\fP option.  The \fIname\fP must be provided with the
\fB--archive-name\fP option.  If the archive name includes a slash
(\fB/\fP) character, then the \fB/part##\fP is omitted.  Thus
\fB-n xyzzy\fP produces:
.nf
    xyzzy/part01
    xyzzy/part02
.fi
.sp
while \fB-n xyzzy/patch\fP produces:
.nf
    xyzzy/patch01
    xyzzy/patch02
.fi
.sp
and \fB-n xyzzy/patch01.\fP produces:
.nf
    xyzzy/patch01.01
    xyzzy/patch01.02
.fi
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-c\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-cut\-mark\f[]
start the shar with a cut line.
.sp
A line saying 'Cut here' is placed at the
start of each output file.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-t\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-translate\f[]
translate messages in the script.
.sp
Translate messages in the script.  If you have set the \fBLANG\fP
environment variable, messages printed by \fBshar\fP will be in the
specified language.  The produced script will still be emitted using
messages in the lingua franca of the computer world: English.  This
option will cause the script messages to appear in the languages
specified by the \fBLANG\fP environment variable set when the script
is produced.
.SS "Protecting against transmission issues"
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no\-character\-count\f[]
do not use `wc \-c' to check size.
.sp
Do NOT check each file with 'wc \-c' after unpack.
The default is to check.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-D\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no\-md5\-digest\f[]
do not use \fBmd5sum\fP digest to verify.
.sp
Do \fInot\fP use \fBmd5sum\fP digest to verify the unpacked files.
The default is to check.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-F\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-force\-prefix\f[]
apply the prefix character on every line.
.sp
Forces the prefix character to be prepended to every line, even if
not required.  This option may slightly increase the size of the archive,
especially if \fB--uuencode\fP or a compression option is used.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-d\f[] \f\*[I-Font]delim\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-here\-delimiter\f[]=\f\*[I-Font]delim\f[]
use \fIdelim\fP to delimit the files.
The default
\f\*[I-Font]delim\f[]
for this option is:
.ti +4
 SHAR_EOF
.sp
Use DELIM to delimit the files in the shar instead of SHAR_EOF.
This is for those who want to personalize their shar files.
The delimiter will always be prefixed and suffixed with underscores.
.SS "Producing different kinds of shars"
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-V\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-vanilla\-operation\f[]
produce very simple shars.
.sp
This option produces \fBvanilla\fP shars which rely only upon the
existence of \fBecho\fP, \fBtest\fP and \fBsed\fP in the
unpacking environment.
.sp
It changes the default behavior from mixed mode
(\fB--mixed-uuencode\fP) to text mode (\fB--text-files\fP).
Warnings are produced if options are specified that will require
decompression or decoding in the unpacking environment.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-P\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no\-piping\f[]
use temporary files between programs.
.sp
In the \fIshar\fP file, use a temporary file to hold file contents
between unpacking stages instead of using pipes.  This option is
mandatory when you know the unpacking will happen on systems that do
not support pipes.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-x\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no\-check\-existing\f[]
blindly overwrite existing files.
.sp
Create the archive so that when processed it will overwrite existing
files without checking first.  If neither this option nor the
\fB--query-user\fP option is specified, the unpack will not
overwrite pre-existing files.  In all cases, however, if
\fB--cut-mark\fP is passed as a parameter to the script when
unpacking, then existing files will be overwritten unconditionally.
.sp
.nf
    sh shar-archive-file \-c
.fi
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-X\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-query\-user\f[]
ask user before overwriting files.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
vanilla-operation.
.sp
When unpacking, interactively ask the user if files should be
overwritten.  Do not use for shars submitted to the net.
.sp
Use of this option produces shars which \fIwill\fP cause problems
with some unshar-style procedures, particularly when used
together with vanilla mode (\fB--vanilla-operation\fP).  Use this
feature mainly for archives to be passed among agreeable parties.
Certainly, \fB-X\fP is \fInot\fP for shell archives which are to be
submitted to Usenet or other public networks.
.sp
The problem is that \fBunshar\fP programs or procedures often feed
\fI/bin/sh\fP from its standard input, thus putting \fI/bin/sh\fP
and the shell archive script in competition for input lines.  As an
attempt to alleviate this problem, \fBshar\fP will try to detect
if \fI/dev/tty\fP exists at the receiving site and will use it to
read user replies.  But this does not work in all cases, it may happen
that the receiving user will have to avoid using \fBunshar\fP
programs or procedures, and call \fI/bin/sh\fP directly.  In vanilla
mode, using \fI/dev/tty\fP is not even attempted.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-m\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no\-timestamp\f[]
do not restore modification times.
.sp
Avoid generating 'touch' commands to restore the file modification
dates when unpacking files from the archive.
.sp
When file modification times are not preserved, project build programs
like "make" will see built files older than the files they get built
from.  This is why, when this option is not used, a special effort is
made to restore timestamps.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-Q\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-quiet\-unshar\f[]
avoid verbose messages at unshar time.
.sp
Verbose OFF.  Disables the inclusion of comments to be output when
the archive is unpacked.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-f\f[], \f\*[B-Font]\-\-basename\f[]
restore in one directory, despite hierarchy.
.sp
Restore by the base file name only, rather than path.  This option
causes only file names to be used, which is useful when building a
shar from several directories, or another directory.  Note that if a
directory name is passed to shar, the substructure of that directory
will be restored whether this option is specified or not.
.SS "Internationalization options"
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-no\-i18n\f[]
do not internationalize.
.sp
Do not produce internationalized shell archives, use default English
messages.  By default, shar produces archives that will try to output
messages in the unpackers preferred language (as determined by the
LANG/LC_MESSAGES environmental variables) when they are unpacked.  If
no message file for the unpackers language is found at unpack time,
messages will be in English.
.TP
.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-\-print\-text\-domain\-dir\f[]

.sp
Prints the directory shar looks in to find messages files
for different languages, then immediately exits.

.NOP \f\*[B-Font]\-v\f[] [{\f\*[I-Font]v|c|n\f[] \f\*[B-Font]\-\-version\f[] [{\f\*[I-Font]v|c|n\f[]}]}]
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.PP
.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
The file "\fI$HOME/.sharrc\fP" will be used, if present.
.SH WARNINGS
No attempt is made to restore the protection and modification dates
for directories, even if this is done by default for files.  Thus, if
a directory is given to \fBshar\fP, the protection and modification
dates of corresponding unpacked directory may not match those of the
original.
.sp
If a directory is passed to shar, it may be scanned more than once, to
conserve memory.  Therefore, do not change the directory contents
while shar is running.
.sp
Be careful that the output file(s) are not included in the inputs or
shar may loop until the disk fills up.  Be particularly careful when a
directory is passed to shar that the output files are not in that
directory or a subdirectory of it.
.sp
Use of the compression and encoding options will slow the archive
process, perhaps considerably.
.sp
Use of the \fB\-\-query\-user\fP produces shars which \fIwill\fP
cause problems with many unshar procedures.  Use this feature only for
archives to be passed among agreeable parties.  Certainly,
\fBquery\-user\fP is NOT for shell archives which are to be
distributed across the net.  The use of compression in net shars will
cause you to be flamed off the earth.  Not using the
\fB\-\-no\-timestamp\fP or \fB\-\-force\-prefix\fP options may also
get you occasional complaints.  Put these options into your
\fI~/.sharrc\fP file.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH EXAMPLES
The first shows how to make a shell archive out of all C program
sources.  The second produces a shell archive with all \fI.c\fP and
\fI.h\fP files, which unpacks silently.  The third gives a shell
archive of all uuencoded \fI.arc\fP files, into numbered files
starting from \fIarc.sh.01\fP.  The last example gives a shell
archive which will use only the file names at unpack time.
